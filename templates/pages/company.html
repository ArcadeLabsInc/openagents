            <p class="text-base mb-4">The future of artificial intelligence cannot belong solely to monolithic mega-corporations using regulatory capture and incestuous relationships with governments to gain power at the expense of the people. AI, like bitcoin, can be a liberating technology.</p>

                <p class="text-base mb-4">Founder & CEO</p>
                <p class="text-base mb-4">Christopher has been writing software since the mid-'90s. Bitcoin class of '11, Nostr class of '21 and a NIP author, he previously founded a successful rideshare startup in Austin. From OpenAI's first dev day in late 2023, he saw the potential for AI agents built on truly open protocols with bitcoin micropayments.</p>
                <p class="text-base mb-4">Since then, he's recorded 150+ videos building in public, shipped multiple MVPs, and developed the vision for a decentralized agents marketplace running on bitcoin and Nostr. The goal: a clean mobile app that doubles as both Nostr client and bitcoin wallet, enabling users to easily interact with their own personal AI agent.</p>
