            <p class="text-sm mb-4">The future of artificial intelligence cannot belong solely to monolithic mega-corporations using regulatory capture and incestuous relationships with governments to gain power at the expense of the people. AI, like bitcoin, can be a liberating technology.</p>

                <p class="text-zinc-300 text-sm">Founder & CEO</p>
                <p class="mt-3 text-sm">From OpenAI's first big 'dev day' presentation in late 2023, Christopher came to believe two things: AI agents would drive the future, and OpenAI's plans to pay developers a share of revenue from their "GPT store" would be half-assed and nowhere near as good as that same idea built with bitcoin micropayments.</p>
                <p class="mt-3 text-sm">The day afterward, he recorded the first video of a now 150+ video series in which we build in public truly open versions of OpenAI's product suite. Multiple MVPs shipped and lessons learned since then, we've arrived at the structure we think will get us to our first million users: a decentralized agents marketplace running on bitcoin and Nostr paired with a clean mobile app - doubling as both Nostr client and bitcoin wallet - enabling users to easily interact with their own personal AI agent connected to that marketplace.</p>
                <p class="mt-3 text-sm">Bitcoin class of '11, Nostr class of '21 and a NIP author, Christopher has been writing software since the mid-'90s. His main claim to fame was winning the ridesharing 'battle for Austin' as the last surviving rideshare startup of the 10 companies that moved to Austin when Uber & Lyft shut down service here for a year in 2016. From that experience he learned a lot about building decentralized, community-driven marketplaces that generate millions of dollars in revenue -- lessons he's excited to apply now to OpenAgents.</p>

            <p class="text-sm mb-3">We're rapidly developing Onyx, our mobile app now in open beta for Android and iOS. It's a beautiful mobile application that provides access to a decentralized marketplace of agents, where providers are incentivized via bitcoin rewards to help build the best agents.</p>
            <p class="text-sm">The app combines:</p>
