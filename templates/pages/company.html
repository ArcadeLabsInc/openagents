            <p class="mb-4">The future of artificial intelligence cannot belong solely to monolithic mega-corporations using regulatory capture and incestuous relationships with governments to gain power at the expense of the people. AI, like bitcoin, can be a liberating technology.</p>

                <p class="text-zinc-300">Founder & CEO</p>
                <p class="mt-4">Bitcoin class of '11, Nostr class of '21 and a NIP author, Christopher has been writing software since the mid-'90s. His main claim to fame was winning the ridesharing 'battle for Austin' as the last surviving rideshare startup of the 10 companies that moved to Austin when Uber & Lyft shut down service here for a year in 2016. From that experience he learned a lot about building decentralized, community-driven marketplaces that generate millions of dollars in revenue -- lessons he's excited to apply now to OpenAgents.</p>
