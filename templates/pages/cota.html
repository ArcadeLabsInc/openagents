    <p>
      We define a <i>chain of thought and action</i> as a series of reasoning
      steps and visible tool use whereby agentic AI systems show both the
      intermediate reasoning and the inputs and outputs of actions taken.

    <p>
      A 'chain of thought' is a series of intermediate reasoning steps that
      significantly improves the ability of large language models to perform
      complex reasoning. Introduced in

        >Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language
        Models</a

      OpenAI has embraced this concept with their O1 series of models, which are
      specifically designed to "spend more time thinking before they respond."
      However, OpenAI has been

      for not showing the chain of thought to users, unlike competitors like
      DeepSeek which display the complete, unedited reasoning steps.

    <h2 class="text-white">And Action</h2>
    <p>
      While chain of thought reveals an AI's reasoning process, we need to
      extend this transparency to actions as well. This section will demonstrate
      how we can make AI systems show not just their thinking, but also their
      tool use and actions in achieving tasks.
