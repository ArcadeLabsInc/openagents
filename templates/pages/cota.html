        A 'chain of thought' is a series of intermediate reasoning steps that significantly improves the ability of large language models to perform complex reasoning. Introduced in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903" class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-300">Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models</a>, this approach emerged as a breakthrough in AI when researchers discovered that by providing a few examples of step-by-step reasoning, language models could naturally learn to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.

        OpenAI has embraced this concept with their O1 series of models, which are specifically designed to "spend more time thinking before they respond." This represents a direct application of chain-of-thought principles in commercial AI systems, where the model deliberately processes information through multiple reasoning steps before producing its final output.
