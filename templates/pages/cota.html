    <p>
        We explore the concept of 'chain of thought and action', a framework that combines transparent reasoning with visible tool use, allowing AI systems to both show their work and demonstrate their actions in achieving goals.

    <h2 class="text-white">Chain of Thought</h2>
    <p>
        A 'chain of thought' is a series of intermediate reasoning steps that significantly improves the ability of large language models to perform complex reasoning. Introduced in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903" class="text-white hover:opacity-75 underline" target="_blank">Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models</a>, this approach emerged as a breakthrough in AI when researchers discovered that by providing a few examples of step-by-step reasoning, language models could naturally learn to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.

        OpenAI has embraced this concept with their O1 series of models, which are specifically designed to "spend more time thinking before they respond." However, OpenAI has been <a href="https://x.com/parshantdeep/status/1834281496850694544" class="text-white hover:opacity-75 underline" target="_blank">criticized</a> for not showing the chain of thought to users, unlike competitors like DeepSeek which make the reasoning process transparent. While OpenAI argues that hiding the chain of thought allows for better monitoring and prevents manipulation, some argue that transparency in reasoning is valuable for building trust and understanding.

    <h2 class="text-white">And Action</h2>
    <p>
        While chain of thought reveals an AI's reasoning process, we need to extend this transparency to actions as well. This section will demonstrate how we can make AI systems show not just their thinking, but also their tool use and actions in achieving tasks.
