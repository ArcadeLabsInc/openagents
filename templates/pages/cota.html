    <p>
        Chain of thought is a series of intermediate reasoning steps that helps large language models perform complex reasoning tasks. This approach emerged as a breakthrough in AI when researchers discovered that by providing a few examples of step-by-step reasoning, language models could naturally learn to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps. The technique has proven particularly effective for tasks ranging from arithmetic and logic puzzles to commonsense reasoning.
