Last modified: April 8, 2024

OpenAgents, Inc. (“OpenAgents,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) has made these Terms of Service available to explain the terms and
conditions by which you may access and use (a) OpenAgents’ products and services, (b) https://openagents.com, and (‎c)
other related products and services that link to these Terms of Service (collectively, the “Platform”). All access and
use of the Platform is subject to the terms and conditions contained in these Terms of Service (as amended from time to
time, the “Terms of Service”). By accessing, browsing, or otherwise using the Platform, you acknowledge that you have

these Terms of Service, you will not access, browse, or otherwise use the Platform.

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change or modify portions of these Terms of Service at any time. If we

were last revised. We will also notify you of any material changes, either through the user interface for the Platform,
a pop-up notice, email, or through other reasonable means. Your continued use of the Platform after the date any such
changes become effective constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Service. You should periodically visit this
page to review the current version of these Terms of Service so you are aware of any revisions. If you do not agree to
abide by these or any future version of these Terms of Service, you will not access, browse, or use (or continue to
access, browse, or use) the Platform.

**_PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY, AS THEY CONTAIN AN AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE AND OTHER IMPORTANT
INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, REMEDIES, AND OBLIGATIONS. THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE REQUIRES (WITH LIMITED
EXCEPTION) THAT YOU SUBMIT CLAIMS YOU HAVE AGAINST US TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION, AND FURTHER (1) YOU WILL ONLY BE

**Your Privacy:** At OpenAgents, we respect the privacy of our users. For more information please see our Privacy
Policy,

use and disclosure of
personal data and other data as outlined therein.

**Additional Terms:** In addition, when using certain features through the Platform, you will be subject to any
additional
terms applicable to such features that may be posted on or within the Platform from time to time. All such terms are
hereby incorporated by reference into these Terms of Service.

**<u>Access and Use of the Platform</u>**

**OpenAgents Platform:** OpenAgents hosts and maintains an online platform that allows developers, compute providers,
data
providers, and other contributors (each a **“Contributor”**) to make available and commercialize their AI-based agents,
models, compute resources, and other assets and content (collectively, “Contributor Assets”) with third party customers
and end users (each an “End User”). OpenAgents and the Platform acts only as an intermediary to facilitate – and not to
direct or control – any relationships, communications, and transactions among the Contributors and End Users.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, OpenAgents reserves the right, but has no obligation, to become involved in any way with
disputes between you and any other user of the Platform.

**License by Contributors:**  If you are a Contributor, by making your Contributor Assets available to End Users through
the
Platform, you hereby grant OpenAgents a nonexclusive, worldwide, royalty-free right and license to use, test, store,
copy, translate, display, modify, distribute, promote, and otherwise make available your Contributor Asset(s) to End
Users. In addition, with respect to each End User that has purchased a license to use your Contributor Asset(s), you
hereby grant such End User (i) a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable right to access and use your
Contributor Asset(s); and (ii) a non-exclusive, sublicensable, transferable, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free right
to use, store, copy, display, distribute, prepare derivative works of and otherwise exploit all output generated from
such End User’s use of your Contributor Asset. You otherwise retain ownership of your Contributor Assets.

**Your Registration Obligations:** You may be required to register with OpenAgents or provide information about
yourself (
e.g., name and email address) in order to access and use certain features of the Platform. If you choose to register for
the Platform, you agree to provide and maintain true, accurate, current, and complete information about yourself as
prompted by the Platform’s registration form. Registration data and certain other information about you are governed by
our Privacy Policy. If you are under 18 years old, you may not use the Platform, with or without registering.

**Export Control:** You may not access or use the Platform, except as authorized by U.S. law, the laws of the
jurisdiction
in which you accessed or used the Platform, as applicable, and any other applicable laws and regulations. In addition,
you represent and warrant that (a) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or
that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and (b) you are not listed on any
U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties. Without limiting the foregoing, if you are located in Russia,
Belarus, Syria, North Korea, Iran, Cuba, Iraq, Afghanistan, Venezuela, Sudan, South Sudan, Crimea region, Donetsk
region, or Luhansk region, you may not use the Platform for any reason.

**Member Account, Password and Security:** You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and
account details, if any, and are fully responsible for any and all activities that occur under your password or account.
You agree to (a) immediately notify OpenAgents of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach
of security, and (b) ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session when accessing the Platform.
OpenAgents will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this paragraph.

**Modifications to Platform:** OpenAgents reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the
Platform (or any part thereof) with or without notice. You agree that OpenAgents will not be liable to you or to any
third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Platform.

**General Practices Regarding Use and Storage:** You acknowledge that OpenAgents may establish general practices and
limits
concerning use of the Platform, including the maximum period of time that data or other content will be retained by the
Platform and the maximum storage space that will be allotted on OpenAgents’ or its third-party service providers’
servers on your behalf. You agree that OpenAgents has no responsibility or liability for the deletion or failure to
store any data or other content maintained or uploaded by the Platform. You acknowledge that OpenAgents reserves the
right to terminate accounts that are inactive for an extended period of time. You further acknowledge that OpenAgents
reserves the right to change these general practices and limits at any time, in its sole discretion, with or without
notice.

**OpenAgents Open Source:**  In addition, the Platform may include software and other content that OpenAgents makes
generally available under the terms of an open source license (“OpenAgents OSS”). Your use of any OpenAgents OSS shall
be subject to the terms of the applicable license for such OpenAgents OSS.

**<u>Conditions of Access and Use</u>**

**User Conduct:** You are solely responsible for all software, models, content, data, information, graphics, messages,

other materials that you make through the Platform, whether to OpenAgents or another user, including as a Contributor
Asset or data or information provided by an End User when using a Contributor Asset (collectively, “User Content”). The
following are examples of the kinds of User Content that are illegal or prohibited by OpenAgents. OpenAgents reserves

g) advertise or offer to sell or buy any goods or services for any business purpose that is not specifically authorized;

h) transmit any data or information considered to be sensitive or otherwise subject to specific protections under
applicable laws beyond any requirements that apply to "personal information" or "personal data" generally, such as for

Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, and other U.S. federal, state or foreign laws
applying specific security standards;

i) further or promote any criminal activity or enterprise or provide instructional information about illegal activities;

including through the use of virtual private networks; or

l) engage in or use any data mining, robots, scraping, or similar data gathering or extraction methods.

If you are blocked by OpenAgents from accessing the Platform (including by blocking your IP address), you agree not to
implement any measures to circumvent such blocking (e.g., by masking your IP address or using a proxy IP address or
virtual private network).

**Fees and Payment**

**Connecting Your Wallet:** In order to engage in transactions on the Platform, you may be
required to connect your digital wallet. Such digital wallets allow you to engage in transactions using the
Bitcoin cryptocurrency on the Bitcoin Lightning Network or another cryptocurrency as supported and

allowed on the Platform. OpenAgents will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your use of a
digital wallet or cryptocurrency in a manner not supported or allowed on the Platform.

**Noncustodial:** The Platform may assist with the facilitation of transactions involving your
cryptocurrency or digital assets (“ **Digital Assets** ”), but neither OpenAgents nor the Platform are
custodians of any Digital Assets and that your use of the Platform does not give OpenAgents custody,
possession, or control of any of your Digital Assets. You affirm that you are aware and acknowledge that
OpenAgents is a non-custodial service provider.

**Transactions Generally.** In connection with the Platform, you may be able to make purchases
using your Digital Assets. Any payments or financial transactions that you engage in via the Platform will
be processed solely through our service providers. We have no control over these payments or
transactions, nor do we have the ability to reverse any payments or transactions. We have no liability to
you or to any third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any payments or
transactions that you engage in via the Platform, or any other payment or transactions that you conduct
via the Platform. We do not provide refunds for any purchases that you might make on or through the
Platform.

**Transaction Fees.** Blockchain transactions may require the payment of a transaction fee (each, a “**Transaction
Fee** ”). The Transaction Fees fund the network of computers that run the decentralized blockchain network. This
means that you may need to pay a Transaction Fee for each transaction that you instigate via the Platform.
Except as otherwise expressly set forth in these Terms of Service, you will be solely responsible to pay
any Transaction Fee for any transaction that you initiate through the Platform.

**Transactions Between Contributors and End Users.** If as an End User you purchase a right to
use a Contributor Asset through the Platform, you agree to pay the amounts displayed through the
Platform. OpenAgents’ payment processor will facilitate transmission of the payment to the corresponding
Contributors, less the OpenAgents Fee (as set forth below) and any other transaction fees. OpenAgents
will be entitled to collect and deduct a transaction fee for transactions made through the Platform in the
amounts displayed to you through the Platform (the “ **OpenAgents Fee** ”).

**Responsibility for Taxes.** You will be solely responsible to pay any and all sales, use, value-
added and other taxes, duties, and assessments (except taxes on our net income) now or hereafter
claimed or imposed by any governmental authority (collectively, the “ **Taxes** ”) associated with your use of
the Platform. Except for income taxes levied on us, you: (a) will pay or reimburse us for all national,
federal, state, local or other taxes and assessments of any jurisdiction, including value added taxes and
taxes as required by international tax treaties, customs or other import or export taxes, and amounts
levied in lieu thereof based on charges set, services performed or payments made hereunder, as are now
or hereafter may be imposed under the authority of any national, state, local or any other taxing
jurisdiction; and (b) will not be entitled to deduct the amount of any such taxes, duties or assessments
from payments (including Transaction Fees) made to us pursuant to these Terms of Service.

**Intellectual Property Rights**

**Platform Content:** You acknowledge and agree that the Platform may contain content or
features (“ **Platform Content** ”) that are protected by copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret, or other
proprietary rights and laws. Except as expressly authorized by OpenAgents, you agree not to modify,
copy, frame, scrape, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute, or create derivative works based on the Platform or
the Platform Content, in whole or in part, except that the foregoing does not apply to your own User
Content (as defined below) that you upload to or make available through the Platform in accordance with
these Terms of Service. Any use of the Platform or the Platform Content other than as specifically
authorized herein is strictly prohibited.

**Trademarks:** The OpenAgents name and logos are trademarks and service marks of
OpenAgents (collectively the “ **OpenAgents Trademarks** ”). Other company, product, and service names
and logos used and displayed via the Platform may be trademarks or service marks of their respective
owners who may or may not endorse or be affiliated with or connected to OpenAgents. Nothing in these

Terms of Service or the Platform should be construed as granting, by implication, estoppel, or otherwise,
any license or right to use any of OpenAgents Trademarks displayed on the Platform, without our prior
written permission in each instance. All goodwill generated from the use of OpenAgents Trademarks will
inure to our exclusive benefit.

**Third-Party Material:** Under no circumstances will OpenAgents be liable in any way for any
content or materials of any third parties (including users), including for any errors or omissions in any
content, or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any such content. You
acknowledge that OpenAgents does not pre-screen content, but that OpenAgents and its designees will
have the right (but not the obligation) in their sole discretion to refuse or remove any content that is
available via the Platform. Without limiting the foregoing, OpenAgents and its designees will have the
right to remove any content that violates these Terms of Service or is deemed by OpenAgents, in its sole
discretion, to be otherwise objectionable. You agree that you must evaluate, and bear all risks associated
with, the use of any content, including any reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of such
content.

**User Content:** You represent and warrant that you own all right, title and interest in and to such
User Content, including all copyrights and rights of publicity contained therein. You assume all risk
associated with your User Content and the transmission of your User Content, and you have sole
responsibility for the accuracy, quality, legality and appropriateness of your User Content. You
acknowledge and agree that OpenAgents may preserve User Content and may also disclose User
Content if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such preservation or disclosure is
reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process, applicable laws, or government requests; (b)
enforce these Terms of Service; (c) respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties;
or (d) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of OpenAgents, its users, or the public. You
understand that the technical processing and transmission of the Platform, including your User Content,
may involve (i) transmissions over various networks; and (ii) changes to conform and adapt to technical
requirements of connecting networks or devices.

**Usage Data:** You hereby authorize OpenAgents and its third-party service providers to collect
and analyze User Content and other data and information relating to the Platform and related systems
and technologies and derive statistical and usage data relating thereto (collectively, “ **Usage Data** ”). We
may use Usage Data for any purpose in accordance with applicable law and our Privacy Policy.

**Feedback:** Any questions, comments, suggestions, ideas, feedback, reviews, or other
information about the Platform (“ **Submissions** ”), provided by you to OpenAgents are non-confidential
and OpenAgents will be entitled to the unrestricted use and dissemination of these Submissions for any
purpose, commercial or otherwise, without acknowledgment, attribution, or compensation to you.

**Copyright Complaints:** OpenAgents respects the intellectual property of others, and we ask our
users to do the same. If you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright
infringement, or that your intellectual property rights have been otherwise violated, you should notify
OpenAgents of your infringement claim in accordance with the procedure set forth below.

OpenAgents will process and investigate notices of alleged infringement and will take appropriate actions
under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) and other applicable intellectual property laws with
respect to any alleged or actual infringement. A notification of claimed copyright infringement should be
mailed to OpenAgents (Subject line: “DMCA Takedown
Request”) at 1101 W 34th St. #581, Austin, TX 78705.

To be effective, the notification must be in writing and contain the following information:

- a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the
  copyright or other intellectual property interest that is allegedly infringed;
- identification of the copyrighted work or other intellectual property that you claim has been infringed, or, if
  multiple copyrighted works or other intellectual property are covered by a single
  notification, a representative list of such works or other intellectual property;
- identification of the content that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity,
  and where the content that you claim is infringing is located on the Platform, with enough detail
  that we may find it on the Platform;
- your address, telephone number, and email address;
- a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the
  copyright or intellectual property owner, its agent, or the law; and
- a statement by you that the information in your notice is accurate and, under penalty of perjury,
  that you are the copyright or intellectual property owner or are authorized to act on the behalf of
  the owner of the copyright or intellectual property that is allegedly infringed.

**_Counter-Notice_**: If you believe that your User Content that was removed (or to which access was
disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright
owner’s agent, or pursuant to the law, to upload and use the content in your User Content, you may send
a written counter-notice containing the following information to the Copyright Agent:

- your physical or electronic signature;
- identification of the content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the
  location at which the content appeared before it was removed or disabled;
- a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that you have a good faith belief that the
  content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the content to be
  removed or disabled; and
- your name, address, telephone number, and email address, a statement that you consent to the
  jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas and a statement
  that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged
  infringement.

If a counter-notice is received by the Copyright Agent, OpenAgents will send a copy of the counter-notice
to the original complaining party informing them that OpenAgents may replace the removed content or
cease disabling it within ten (10) business days. Unless the owner of the applicable copyrighted work or
other intellectual property files an action seeking a court order against OpenAgents or the user, the
removed content may be replaced, or access to it restored, within ten (10) to fourteen (14) business days
or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at our sole discretion.

**_Repeat Infringer Policy_** : In accordance with the DMCA and other applicable law, OpenAgents
has adopted a policy of terminating, in appropriate circumstances and at OpenAgents’ sole discretion, the
accounts of users who are deemed to be repeat infringers. OpenAgents may also at its sole discretion
limit access to the Platform and/or terminate the accounts of any users who infringe any intellectual
property rights of others, whether or not there is any repeat infringement.

**Third-Party Platforms and Websites**

The Platform may provide links or other access to services, sites, technology, and resources that are
provided or otherwise made available by third parties (the “ **Third-Party Platforms** ”). Your access and use
of the Third-Party Platforms may also be subject to additional terms and conditions, privacy policies, or
other agreements with such third party, and you may be required to authenticate to or create separate
accounts to use Third-Party Platforms on the websites or via the technology platforms of their respective
providers. Some Third-Party Platforms will provide us with access to certain information that you have
provided to third parties, including through such Third-Party Platforms, and we will use, store and disclose
such information in accordance with our Privacy Policy. For more information about the implications of
activating Third-Party Platforms and our use, storage and disclosure of information related to you and
your use of such Third-Party Platforms within the Platform, please see our Privacy Policy. OpenAgents
has no control over and is not responsible for such Third-Party Platforms, including for the accuracy,
availability, reliability, or completeness of information shared by or available through Third-Party
Platforms, or on the privacy practices of Third-Party Platforms. We encourage you to review the privacy
policies of the third parties providing Third-Party Platforms prior to using such services. You, and not
OpenAgents, will be responsible for any and all costs and charges associated with your use of any Third-

Party Platforms. OpenAgents enables these Third-Party Platforms merely as a convenience and the
integration or inclusion of such Third-Party Platforms does not imply an endorsement or recommendation.
Any dealings you have with third parties while using the Platform are between you and the third party.
OpenAgents will not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or
alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any Third-Party Platforms.

**Indemnification**

To the extent permitted under applicable law, you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless
OpenAgents, its affiliates, and its and their respective officers, employees, directors, service providers,
licensors, and agents (collectively, the “ **OpenAgent Parties** ”) from any and all losses, damages,
expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, rights, claims, actions of any kind, and injury (including
death) arising out of or relating to your use of the Platform, any User Content (including your Contributor
Assets), your connection to the Platform, your violation of these Terms of Service, or your violation of any
rights of another. OpenAgents will provide notice to you of any such claim, suit, or proceeding.
OpenAgents reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter which is
subject to indemnification under this section, and you agree to cooperate with any reasonable requests
assisting OpenAgents’ defense of such matter. You may not settle or compromise any claim against the
OpenAgent Parties without OpenAgents’ written consent.

**Disclaimer of Warranties**

YOUR USE OF THE PLATFORM IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. THE PLATFORM IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS
IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. THE OPENAGENT PARTIES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE,
AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

THE OPENAGENT PARTIES MAKE NO WARRANTY THAT (A) THE PLATFORM WILL MEET YOUR
REQUIREMENTS; (B) THE PLATFORM WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, OR ERROR-
FREE; (C) THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE USE OF THE PLATFORM WILL BE
ACCURATE OR RELIABLE; OR (D) THE QUALITY OF ANY PRODUCTS, SERVICES, INFORMATION,
OR OTHER MATERIAL PURCHASED OR OBTAINED BY YOU THROUGH THE PLATFORM WILL
MEET YOUR EXPECTATIONS.

**Limitation of Liability**

YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT THE OPENAGENT PARTIES WILL NOT BE
LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY DAMAGES,
OR DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, USE, OR
DATA OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (EVEN IF THE OPENAGENT PARTIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED
OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT,
NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, RESULTING FROM: (A) THE USE OR THE
INABILITY TO USE THE PLATFORM; (B) THE COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS
AND SERVICES RESULTING FROM ANY GOODS, DATA, INFORMATION, OR SERVICES
PURCHASED OR OBTAINED OR MESSAGES RECEIVED OR TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO
THROUGH OR FROM THE PLATFORM; (C) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR ALTERATION OF
YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR DATA; (D) STATEMENTS OR CONDUCT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE
PLATFORM; OR (E) ANY OTHER MATTER RELATING TO THE PLATFORM. IN NO EVENT WILL THE
OPENAGENT PARTIES’ TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, OR CAUSES OF
ACTION EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID OPENAGENTS IN THE LAST SIX (6) MONTHS, OR,
IF GREATER, ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100).

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE DISCLAIMER OR EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN
WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY, SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS SET FORTH
ABOVE MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU OR BE ENFORCEABLE WITH RESPECT TO YOU. IF YOU ARE
DISSATISFIED WITH ANY PORTION OF THE PLATFORM OR WITH THESE TERMS OF SERVICE,

YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO DISCONTINUE USE OF THE PLATFORM.

IF YOU ARE A USER FROM NEW JERSEY, THE FOREGOING SECTIONS TITLED
“INDEMNIFICATION”, “DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES” AND “LIMITATION OF LIABILITY” ARE INTENDED TO BE ONLY AS BROAD AS IS
PERMITTED UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY. IF ANY PORTION OF THESE SECTIONS IS HELD TO BE INVALID UNDER THE
LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY, THE INVALIDITY OF SUCH PORTION WILL NOT AFFECT THE VALIDITY OF THE REMAINING PORTIONS
OF THE APPLICABLE SECTIONS.

**Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration**

**PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.**

a. **Agreement to Arbitrate**
This Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section is referred to in these Terms of Service as the
“Arbitration Agreement.” You agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise
between you and OpenAgents, whether arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service (including any
alleged breach thereof), the Platform, any advertising, or any aspect of the relationship or transactions
between us, will be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court, in
accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that you may assert individual claims in
small claims court, if your claims qualify. Further, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from
bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law
allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into these Terms of Service, you
and OpenAgents are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. Your rights
will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the
interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.

**b. Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief**

**_YOU AND OPENAGENTS AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER
ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY
PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND
OPENAGENTS AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE
THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY
FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE
ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY
RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE
EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL
CLAIM(S), EXCEPT THAT YOU MAY PURSUE A CLAIM FOR AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD
PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF UNDER APPLICABLE LAW TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED FOR THE
ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS PROVISION._**

**c. Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution**

OpenAgents is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most customer
concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer’s satisfaction by contacting customer support at
@OpenAgentsInc on X. If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first
send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“ **Notice** ”). The Notice to OpenAgents
should be sent to 1101 W 34th St. #581, Austin, TX 78705 (“ **Notice Address** ”). The Notice must (i) describe the
nature
and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. If OpenAgents and you do not
resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or OpenAgents may
commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by
OpenAgents or you will not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to
which you or OpenAgents is entitled.

**d. Arbitration Procedures**

Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration
Association’s (“AAA”) rules and procedures, including the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively,
the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For information on the AAA, please visit its
website, https://www.adr.org. Information about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be
found at the AAA’s consumer arbitration page, https://www.adr.org/consumer. If there is any inconsistency
between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of
this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the
inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator
must also follow the provisions of these Terms of Service as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator
to decide, including issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration
Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and
other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis
that a court can award to an individual under these Terms of Service and applicable law. Decisions by the
arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.

Unless OpenAgents and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably
convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent
circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination will be made by AAA. If
your claim is for $10,000 or less, OpenAgents agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be
conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or
by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a
hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is
conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings
and conclusions on which the award is based.

**e. Costs of Arbitration**

Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the “Arbitration Fees”) will be
governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement. To the extent any
Arbitration Fees are not specifically allocated to either OpenAgents or you under the AAA Rules,
OpenAgents and you shall split them equally; provided that if you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator
that you are economically unable to pay your portion of such Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise
determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of any Arbitration Fees,
OpenAgents will pay your portion of such fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the
costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, OpenAgents will pay as much
of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-
prohibitive. Any payment of attorneys’ fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.

**f. Confidentiality**

All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly
confidential for the benefit of all parties.

**g. Severability**

If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement (other than the
subsection (b) above titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized
Relief” above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term
or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid
or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement will be enforceable as so modified. If a
court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of subsection (b) above titled “Prohibition of Class
and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety

of this Arbitration Agreement will be null and void, unless such provisions are deemed to be invalid or
unenforceable solely with respect to claims for public injunctive relief. The remainder of these Terms of
Service will continue to apply.

**h. Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement**

Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms of Service to the contrary, OpenAgents agrees that if it
makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address) while
you are a user of the Platform, you may reject any such change by sending OpenAgents written notice
within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any
future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the
language of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted these Terms of Service (or
accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms of Service).

**Termination**

You agree that OpenAgents, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate your account (or any part
thereof) or use of the Platform and remove and discard any content within the Platform, for any reason,
including for lack of use or if OpenAgents believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the
letter or spirit of these Terms of Service. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive, or illegal activity that may be
grounds for termination of your use of the Platform, may be referred to appropriate law enforcement
authorities. OpenAgents may also in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue providing the Platform,
or any part thereof, with or without notice. You agree that any termination of your access to the Platform
under any provision of these Terms of Service may be effected without prior notice, and acknowledge and
agree that OpenAgents may immediately deactivate or delete your account and all related information
and files in your account and/or bar any further access to such files or the Platform. Further, you agree
that OpenAgents will not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your access to the
Platform.

**User Disputes**

You agree that you are solely responsible for your interactions with any other user in connection with the
Platform, and OpenAgents will have no liability or responsibility with respect thereto. OpenAgents
reserves the right, but has no obligation, to become involved in any way with disputes between you and
any other user of the Platform.

**General**

These Terms of Service (together with the terms incorporated by reference herein) constitute the entire
agreement between you and OpenAgents governing your access and use of the Platform, and supersede
any prior agreements between you and OpenAgents with respect to the Platform. You also may be
subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use Third-Party Platforms, third-party
content or third-party software. These Terms of Service will be governed by the laws of the State of Texas
without regard to its conflict of law provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to
arbitration, as set forth above, you and OpenAgents submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of
the state and federal courts located within Austin, Texas. The failure of OpenAgents to exercise or enforce
any right or provision of these Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If
any provision of these Terms of Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the
parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as
reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms of Service remain in full force and
effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising
out of or related to use of the Platform or these Terms of Service must be filed within one (1) year after
such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. A printed version of these Terms of Service and
of any notice given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based
upon or relating to these Terms of Service to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other
business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. You may not assign
these Terms of Service without the prior written consent of OpenAgents, but OpenAgents may assign or

transfer these Terms of Service, in whole or in part, without restriction. The section titles in these Terms of
Service are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. As used in these Terms of
Service, the words “include” and “including,” and variations thereof, will not be deemed to be terms of
limitation, but rather will be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.” Notices to you may
be made via either email or regular mail. The Platform may also provide notices to you of changes to
these Terms of Service or other matters by displaying notices or links to notices generally on the Platform.
OpenAgents will not be in default hereunder by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of its
obligations where such failure or delay is due to civil disturbances, riot, epidemic, hostilities, war, terrorist
attack, embargo, natural disaster, acts of God, flood, fire, sabotage, fluctuations or unavailability of
electrical power, network access or equipment, or any other circumstances or causes beyond
OpenAgents’ reasonable control.
