# Introducing the Agent Store

#### May 13, 2024

Today we launch the **Agent Store**, the world's first AI agent marketplace.

Now anyone in the world can create AI agents and earn a share of their revenue.

The Agent Store is live now at [openagents.com](https://openagents.com) and we invite you to try it:

- Explore agents: [openagents.com/store](https://openagents.com/store)
- Build agents: [openagents.com/create](https://openagents.com/create)
- Read the docs: [openagents.com/docs](https://openagents.com/docs)

## Don't believe us

The AI space is full of scams and hype.

Any antidote requires true openness.

We built this platform in public over the last six months, 100% open source and [documented in 90+ videos](https://github.com/OpenAgentsInc/openagents/wiki/Video-Series).

Because we're a small team on a shoestring budget, our product is still a little rough around the edges. But the basic functionality is working and ready for your ---.

## But here's the problem

There are no good AI agents working reliably in production - anywhere.

If you know of any, please let us know.

## misc

- Agent builders can now earn revenue share

where creators earn recurring revenue streams, no matter where they are in the world.

We began this

We haven't even launched and we've already paid more developers than they have.
