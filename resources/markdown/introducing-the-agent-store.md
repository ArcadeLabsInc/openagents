# Introducing the Agent Store

#### May 13, 2024

Today we launch the **Agent Store**, the world's first AI agent marketplace with revenue sharing paid daily in bitcoin.

Now anyone in the world can create AI agents and earn a share of their revenue.

The Agent Store is live now at [openagents.com](https://openagents.com) and we invite you to try it.

- Explore agents: [openagents.com/store](https://openagents.com/store)
- Build agents: [openagents.com/build](https://openagents.com/create)
- Read the docs: [docs.openagents.com](https://docs.openagents.com)

## How it works

Anyone can create an agent with our Agent Builder.

Developers can extend agent functionality by ___

You earn bitcoin sats proportional to usage, paid daily.

- For the next few weeks, these will be manual payouts processed once daily
- When we develop *good* agents, we'll launch pay-as-you-go and you earn a share of the revenue paid for the agents

## But here's the problem

There are no good AI agents working reliably in production - anywhere.

If you know of any, please let us know.

## OPEN OR DIE

The AI space is full of scams and hype.

Any antidote requires true openness.

We built this platform in public over the last six months, 100% open source and [documented in 90+ videos](https://github.com/OpenAgentsInc/openagents/wiki/Video-Series).

Because we're a small team on a shoestring budget, our product is still a little rough around the edges. But the basic functionality is working and ready for your ---.

## misc

- Agent builders can now earn revenue share

where creators earn recurring revenue streams, no matter where they are in the world.

We began this

We haven't even launched and we've already paid more developers than they have.

OpenAI has paid zero developers.
