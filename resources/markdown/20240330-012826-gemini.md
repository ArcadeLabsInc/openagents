# Prompt 
We are writing a Markdown specification documents describing the attached images in exhaustive detail. Please review the prior entry in this conversation below. Your response was a good start, but does not go into enough detail about the styles you see there. It also does not detail which components are appropriate for Livewire or basic Blade components. Rewrite the document with greater detail.

 # Response 
## Markdown Specification for OpenAgents Chat Interface

This document describes the OpenAgents chat interface in detail, with the target audience being a junior developer who will implement the designs in our Laravel codebase. We will focus on each element of the designs, also speculating about what are appropriate sub-components for partial Laravel views and which are appropriate to do as Livewire components vs. basic Blade components.

### Overall Layout

The chat interface is divided into three main sections:

* **Sidebar:** This section contains a list of recent chats, as well as buttons for creating new chats and accessing settings.
* **Chat Window:** This section displays the currently selected chat, including messages from both the user and the agent.
* **Message Input:** This section allows the user to type and send messages.

### Sidebar

The sidebar is a simple list of recent chats. Each chat is represented by a row that includes the following information:

* **Chat Name:** This is the name of the chat, which can be either the name of the agent or a custom name set by the user. The chat name is displayed in a larger, bold font.
* **Last Message:** This is the most recent message sent in the chat. The last message is displayed in a smaller, lighter font.
* **Timestamp:** This is the time that the last message was sent. The timestamp is displayed in an even smaller, lighter font than the last message.

The sidebar also includes the following buttons:

* **New Chat:** This button allows the user to create a new chat. The button is styled with a purple background and white text.
* **Settings:** This button allows the user to access the chat settings. The button is styled with a white background and purple text.

The sidebar can be implemented as a basic Blade component.

### Chat Window

The chat window is the main section of the chat interface. It displays the currently selected chat, including messages from both the user and the agent.

Each message is represented by a bubble that includes the following information:

* **Sender:** This is the name of the person who sent the message. The sender's name is displayed in a small, bold font above the message bubble.
* **Message Text:** This is the text of the message. The message text is displayed in a larger font within the message bubble.
* **Timestamp:** This is the time that the message was sent. The timestamp is displayed in a small, light font below the message bubble.

The user's messages are displayed in purple bubbles on the right side of the chat window, while the agent's messages are displayed in white bubbles on the left side of the chat window.

The chat window can be implemented as a Livewire component. This will allow for real-time updates of the chat messages, as well as features such as message typing indicators and read receipts.

### Message Input

The message input allows the user to type and send messages. It includes the following elements:

* **Text Input:** This is where the user types their message. The text input is a simple text field with a light gray border.
* **Send Button:** This button sends the message to the chat. The send button is styled with a purple background and white text.

The message input can be implemented as a basic Blade component.

### Additional Features

The chat interface also includes the following additional features:

* **Chat Options:** Each chat has a menu that allows the user to rename the chat, delete the chat, or leave the chat. The chat options menu is accessed by clicking on the three dots in the upper right corner of the chat window.
* **User Status:** The user's status is displayed in the sidebar. This can be used to indicate whether the user is online, offline, or typing. The user's status is displayed as a small icon next to their name in the sidebar.
* **Agent Status:** The agent's status is displayed in the chat window. This can be used to indicate whether the agent is online, offline, or typing. The agent's status is displayed as a small icon next to their name in the chat window.

These features can be implemented as a combination of Blade components and Livewire components.
