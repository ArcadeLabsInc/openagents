  collect certain information from your account, depending on the privacy permissions you have configured within that
  account.

  sources, and data providers.

**Automatic data collection.** We, our advertising partners, and our service providers may automatically log information
about you, your computer or mobile device, and your interaction over time with our website and the Services, our
communications and other online services, such as:

- **Device data,** such as your computer’s or mobile device’s operating system type and version, manufacturer and model,
  browser type, screen resolution, RAM and disk size, CPU usage, device type (e.g., phone, tablet), IP address, language
  settings, mobile device carrier, radio/network information (e.g., WiFi, LTE, 3G), and general location information
  such as city, state, or geographic area.

  visited before browsing to the website, navigation paths between pages or screens, information about your activity on
  a page or screen, access times, and duration of access, and whether you have opened our marketing emails or clicked
  links within them.

**We use the following tools for automatic data collection:**

- **Cookies,** which are text files that websites store on a visitor’s device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser
  or to store information or settings in the browser for the purpose of helping you navigate between pages efficiently,
  remembering your preferences, enabling functionality, and helping us understand user activity and patterns.

  of data, including on your device outside of your browser in connection with specific applications.

  accessed or opened, or that certain content was viewed or clicked.

  similar technologies to collect information about your interaction over time across the Services, our communications,
  and other online services, and use that information to serve online ads that they think will interest you. This is
  called interest-based advertising. We may also share information about our users with these companies to facilitate
  interest-based advertising to our or similar users (known as a “lookalike audience”) on other online platforms. You
  can learn more about your choices for limiting interest-based advertising in the “Limit online tracking” section
  below.
