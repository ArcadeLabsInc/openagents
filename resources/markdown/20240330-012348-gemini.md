# Prompt 
We are writing a new Markdown specification describing the attached images in exhaustive detail, with the target audience being a junior developer who will implement the designs in our Laravel codebase. Write a document that will help the developer implement the designs. Focus on each element of the designs, also speculating about what are appropriate sub-components for partial Laravel views and which are appropriate to do as Livewire components vs. basic Blade components.

 # Response 
## Markdown Specification for OpenAgents Chat Interface

This document describes the OpenAgents chat interface in detail, with the target audience being a junior developer who will implement the designs in our Laravel codebase. We will focus on each element of the designs, also speculating about what are appropriate sub-components for partial Laravel views and which are appropriate to do as Livewire components vs. basic Blade components.

### Overall Layout

The chat interface is divided into three main sections:

* **Sidebar:** This section contains a list of recent chats, as well as buttons for creating new chats and accessing settings.
* **Chat Window:** This section displays the currently selected chat, including messages from both the user and the agent.
* **Message Input:** This section allows the user to type and send messages.

### Sidebar

The sidebar is a simple list of recent chats. Each chat is represented by a row that includes the following information:

* **Chat Name:** This is the name of the chat, which can be either the name of the agent or a custom name set by the user.
* **Last Message:** This is the most recent message sent in the chat.
* **Timestamp:** This is the time that the last message was sent.

The sidebar also includes the following buttons:

* **New Chat:** This button allows the user to create a new chat.
* **Settings:** This button allows the user to access the chat settings.

The sidebar can be implemented as a basic Blade component.

### Chat Window

The chat window is the main section of the chat interface. It displays the currently selected chat, including messages from both the user and the agent.

Each message is represented by a bubble that includes the following information:

* **Sender:** This is the name of the person who sent the message.
* **Message Text:** This is the text of the message.
* **Timestamp:** This is the time that the message was sent.

The chat window can be implemented as a Livewire component. This will allow for real-time updates of the chat messages, as well as features such as message typing indicators and read receipts.

### Message Input

The message input allows the user to type and send messages. It includes the following elements:

* **Text Input:** This is where the user types their message.
* **Send Button:** This button sends the message to the chat.

The message input can be implemented as a basic Blade component.

### Additional Features

The chat interface also includes the following additional features:

* **Chat Options:** Each chat has a menu that allows the user to rename the chat, delete the chat, or leave the chat.
* **User Status:** The user's status is displayed in the sidebar. This can be used to indicate whether the user is online, offline, or typing.
* **Agent Status:** The agent's status is displayed in the chat window. This can be used to indicate whether the agent is online, offline, or typing.

These features can be implemented as a combination of Blade components and Livewire components.
