# One agent to rule them all

## March 14, 2024

Today we launch OpenAgents, the world's first AI agent swarm capable of recursive daily improvement through
crowdsourcing and bitcoin incentives.

It begins with a simple chatbox on our [homepage](/):

Behind that chatbox sits an upgradeable 'meta-agent' that will route your request to the best agent or
function for the task.

Right now OpenAgents is only good at three things: 1) general conversation, 2) introducing you to OpenAgents, and 3)
answering questions
about stock and bitcoin prices.

Starting now, agent builders can earn bitcoin revenue by contributing upgrades to the agent swarm. (See
documentation for details.)

Anytime a user pays an agent for a task that uses your upgrade, you get a piece of that revenue added immediately to
your
account, which you can withdraw anytime via bitcoin.
