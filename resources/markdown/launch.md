# One agent to rule them all

## March 14, 2024

Today we launch OpenAgents, the world's first AI agent swarm capable of recursive daily improvement through
crowdsourcing and bitcoin incentives.

While a few Californians high on various drugs fantasize themselves masters or slaves to some new AI god, the rest of us
can do the real work of harnessing this technology for the advancement of humanity.

Missing from the AI community to date has been any substantive collaboration between applied AI projects. What the AI/ML
research community has in HuggingFace, applied AI has no equivalent. Hopefully that changes now.

## Enter OpenAgents

This effort [began](https://twitter.com/OpenAgentsInc/status/1721942435125715086) with us taking aim at the OpenAI "GPT
store", which we predicted correctly when it was announced four months ago would have only half-baked or non-existent
monetization. We saw a clear way to improve upon using the global and permissionless internet money that is bitcoin.

Get ready for this shit
