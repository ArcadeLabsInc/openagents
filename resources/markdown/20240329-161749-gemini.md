## Test for Uploading Files to Gemini using the File API

Here's a test for uploading files to Gemini using the File API, based on the provided information:

**File:** `tests/Feature/GeminiTest.php`

```php
<?php

use App\AI\GeminiAIGateway;

test('can upload file and use it in inference with Gemini File API', function () {
    $gemini = new GeminiAIGateway();

    // Prepare file data
    $imagePath = 'path/to/your/image.jpg'; // Replace with actual image path
    $fileData = file_get_contents($imagePath);

    // Upload the file using File API (assuming a method exists in GeminiAIGateway)
    $fileId = $gemini->uploadFile($fileData, 'image/jpeg'); // Adjust mimeType as needed

    // Prepare the prompt with the file reference
    $prompt = [
        'contents' => [
            [
                'parts' => [
                    ['text' => 'Describe this image in detail.'],
                    ['file' => $fileId], // Reference the uploaded file
                ],
            ],
        ],
    ];

    // Send the prompt to the Gemini API
    $response = $gemini->inference($prompt, 'new'); // Use the appropriate model

    // Assert the response structure
    expect($response)->toBeArray();
    expect($response)->toHaveKey('candidates');

    // Add more specific assertions based on the expected response content
    // For example, you might expect the response to contain a description of the uploaded image
});
```

**Notes:**

* This test assumes that the `GeminiAIGateway` class has a method called `uploadFile` that handles the file upload process using the File API. You might need to implement this method based on the specific API implementation.
* Replace `'path/to/your/image.jpg'` with the actual path to your test image file.
* Adjust the `mimeType` parameter in `uploadFile` and the prompt structure according to the file type you are testing.
* Add more specific assertions to the response based on the expected behavior of your prompt and the uploaded file.

This test covers the basic flow of uploading a file using the File API and referencing it in a Gemini API prompt. You can expand on this test to cover different file types, error scenarios, and more complex prompt structures.
