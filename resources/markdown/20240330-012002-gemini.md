# Prompt

We are writing a new Markdown specification describing the attached images in exhaustive detail, with the target
audience being a junior developer who will implement the designs in our Laravel codebase. Write a document that will
help the developer implement the designs. Focus on each element of the designs, also speculating about what are
appropriate sub-components for partial Laravel views and which are appropriate to do as Livewire components vs. basic
Blade components.

## OpenAgents Design Implementation Guide

This document provides guidance for implementing the OpenAgents designs in our Laravel codebase. We'll analyze each
element and discuss appropriate sub-components and the choice between Livewire and Blade components.

### routes/web.php

This file defines the application's routes. Key points:

* **Livewire Components:** Routes like `/` and `/chat/{id}` use Livewire components (`Frontpage` and `Chat`). These
  components handle dynamic interactions and real-time updates without full page reloads.
* **Static Pages:** Routes like `/pro`, `/launch`, and `/docs` use a controller (`StaticController`) to render static
  content. These are suitable for Blade templates.
* **Auth Routes:** Routes like `/reset/account/change-password` and `/verify/account` also use Livewire components for
  interactive forms and user actions.
* **Catch-all Redirect:** The final route redirects any unmatched URLs to the homepage.

### app/AI/GeminiAIGateway.php

This class interacts with the Gemini AI API. It handles:

* **Inference:** Sending prompts to the API and receiving responses. This involves choosing the appropriate model based
  on the prompt type (text or text+image).
* **Chat:** Sending chat messages and receiving responses.
* **File Upload:** Uploading files to the API.
* **File Listing:** Retrieving a list of uploaded files.

These methods are primarily used within Livewire components to fetch data and update the UI dynamically.

### resources/markdown/launch.md

This Markdown file contains content for the launch page. It includes:

* **Text and Images:** The content is a mix of text and images. Consider using Blade components to render the Markdown
  content and display the images.
* **Twitter Embed:** The embedded tweet can be handled using a Blade component or a JavaScript library.

### resources/markdown/docs.md

This Markdown file contains developer documentation. Similar to `launch.md`, use Blade components to render the content
and images.

### Sub-components and Livewire vs. Blade

Here's a breakdown of potential sub-components and the choice between Livewire and Blade:

**Livewire Components:**

* **Chat Interface:** The chat interface is highly dynamic and requires real-time updates. Livewire is ideal for
  handling user interactions, sending messages, and displaying responses.
* **Agent Management:** If there's a section for managing agents, Livewire can handle creating, editing, and deleting
  agents dynamically.
* **File Upload:** Livewire can manage file uploads with progress bars and feedback.

**Blade Components:**

* **Navigation:** The navigation bar can be a Blade component for consistent rendering across pages.
* **Static Content:** Sections like "About Us" or "Contact" can be static Blade components.
* **Markdown Rendering:** Use Blade components to render Markdown content and display images.

**General Considerations:**

* Use Livewire for components that require frequent updates and user interactions without full page reloads.
* Use Blade for static content and components that don't require dynamic behavior.
* Consider breaking down complex components into smaller, reusable sub-components for better organization and
  maintainability.

Remember, this is a general guide. The specific implementation choices will depend on the complexity and functionality
of each component.
