# Prompt 
Fix my GeminiAIGateway. The inference method should use either the default Gemini model or the new pro model. If pro, the URL must be v1beta not v1. Chat should be the old model only. Code: \n ### File: app/AI/GeminiAIGateway.php

### File: resources/markdown/docs.md

```# Developer documentation

OpenAgents.com is a platform for building and commercializing AI agents using shared databases of skills and knowledge.

## Concepts

* The primary chat interface at OpenAgents.com allows users to interact with our meta-agent called "OpenAgents", which
  is
  composed of multiple
  Agents.

* Agents are built from interchangeable building blocks called Nodes which are organized into sequences called Flows.

* Example Nodes include: API endpoints, conditional logic, data parsing, and third-party integrations.

* Nodes can be created by community developers by uploading WASM plugins.

* Plugins are a special type of Node that allows for bespoke operations and enhanced capabilities.

* Each Node may have an associated fee, payable to its creator upon use.

* Nodes can reference an agent's Files.

* Users converse with Agents in conversations that are Threads of Messages.

* A Run is an instance of executing a Flow.

## Definitions

* **Agent** - An AI entity executing defined tasks
* **Thread** - A message chain between user and agent
* **Message** - A single communication in a thread
* **File** - Document processed or created by agents
* **Run** - The active execution of an agent flow
* **Flow** - A sequence of nodes
* **Node** - An individual task within a flow
* **Plugin** - A WebAssembly binary extending agent functionality

## Getting paid for agent upgrades

Payouts are Bitcoin only, paid via the Lightning network.

For now this process is semi-manual.

1. Write an Extism plugin using one of their eight [plugin development kits](https://extism.org/docs/concepts/pdk/). It
   must
   expose one function called 'run' that takes a single string parameter and returns a single string. (Use JSON
   stringification as needed for larger objects.)
2. Upload the code to a GitHub repo.
3. Send us a [DM us on X](https://twitter.com/OpenAgentsInc) (@OpenAgentsInc) with 1) a public-facing name and
   description for the plugin, 2) the link to the GitHub repo and 3) your
   [Lightning address](https://lightningaddress.com/)

The first 100 developers to submit a plugin we add to OpenAgents will receive ₿1M each (~$730 USD as of 3/14).

## API overview

We will soon release a developer API.

You can watch a video introducing it here:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Episode 85: API Design<br><br>We introduce the OpenAgents API and compare it to the OpenAI Assistants API.<br><br>re: <a href="https://t.co/1RDnbvE7yO">https://t.co/1RDnbvE7yO</a> <a href="https://t.co/0cotmwx1BS">pic.twitter.com/0cotmwx1BS</a></p>&mdash; OpenAgents ⚡ (@OpenAgentsInc) <a href="https://twitter.com/OpenAgentsInc/status/1762596179643371596?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 27, 2024</a></blockquote>

```# Gemini API Overview

*Markdown version of [Gemini API Overview](https://ai.google.dev/docs/gemini_api_overview) retrieved March 28, 2024*

## Introduction

The Gemini API gives you access to the latest generative models from Google. Once you're familiar with the general
features available to you through the API, try a quickstart for your language of choice to start developing.

## Models

Gemini is a series of multimodal generative AI models developed by Google. Gemini models can accept text and image in
prompts, depending on what model variation you choose, and output text responses. The legacy PaLM models accept
text-only and output text responses.

- To get more detailed model information refer to the models page.
- You can also use the `list_models` method to list all the models available and then the `get_model` method to get the
  metadata for a particular model.

## Prompt Data and Design

Specific Gemini models accept both images and text data as input. This capability creates many additional possibilities
for generating content, analyzing data, and solving problems. There are some limitations and requirements to consider,
including the general input token limit for the model you are using. For information on the token limits for specific
models, see Gemini models.

### Image Requirements for Prompts

Prompts that use image data are subject to the following limitations and requirements:

- Images must be in one of the following image data MIME types:
    - PNG - `image/png`
    - JPEG - `image/jpeg`
    - WEBP - `image/webp`
    - HEIC - `image/heic`
    - HEIF - `image/heif`
- Maximum of 16 individual images
- Maximum of 4MB for the entire prompt, including images and text
- No specific limits to the number of pixels in an image; however, larger images are scaled down to fit a maximum
  resolution of 3072 x 3072 while preserving their original aspect ratio.

#### Recommendations:

- Prompts with a single image tend to yield better results.

### Prompt Design and Text Input

Creating effective prompts, or prompt engineering, is a combination of art and science. See the prompt guidelines for
guidance on how to approach prompting and the prompt 101 guide to learn about different approaches to prompting.

## Generate Content

The Gemini API lets you use both text and image data for prompting, depending on what model variation you use. For
example, you can generate text using text prompts with the gemini-pro model and use both text and image data to prompt
the gemini-pro-vision model. This section gives simple code examples of each. Refer to the generateContent API reference
for a more detailed example that covers all of the parameters.

### Text and Image Input

You can send a text prompt with an image to the gemini-pro-vision model to perform a vision related task. For example,
captioning an image or identifying what's in an image.

**Note:** You can't send a text-only prompt to the gemini-pro-vision model. Use the gemini-pro model for text-only
prompts.

#### Code Example:

```bash
curl https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1/models/gemini-pro-vision:GenerateContent?key=${API_KEY} \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d @<(echo'{
          "contents":[
            { "parts":[
                {"text": "Do these look store-bought or homemade?"},
                { "inlineData": {
                    "mimeType": "image/png",
                    "data": "'$(base64 -w0 cookie.png)'"
                  }
                }
              ]
            }
          ]
         }')
```

### Text Only Input

The Gemini API can also handle text-only input. This feature lets you perform natural language processing (NLP) tasks
such as text completion and summarization.

#### Code Example:

```
curl https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1/models/gemini-pro:generateContent?key=$API_KEY \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-X POST \
-d '{ "contents":[
{ "parts":[{"text": "Write a story about a magic backpack"}]}
]
}'
```

## Multi-Turn Conversations (Chat)

You can use the Gemini API to build interactive chat experiences for your users. Using the chat feature of the API lets
you collect multiple rounds of questions and responses, allowing users to incrementally step toward answers or get help
with multi-part problems. This feature is ideal for applications that require ongoing communication, such as chatbots,
interactive tutors, or customer support assistants.

#### Code Example:

```
curl https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-pro:generateContent?key=$API_KEY \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-X POST \
-d '{
"contents": [
{"role":"user",
"parts":[{
"text": "Pretend you're a snowman and stay in character for each
{"role": "model",
response."}]},
"parts":[{
"text": "Hello! It's so cold! Isn't that great?"}]},
{"role": "user",
"parts":[{
"text": "What\'s your favorite season of the year?"}]},
]
}' 2> /dev/null | grep "text"
# response example:
"text": "Winter, of course!"
```

## Streamed Responses

The Gemini API provides an additional way to receive responses from generative AI models: as a data stream. A streamed
response sends incremental pieces of data back to your application as it is generated by the model. This feature lets
you respond quickly to a user request to show progress and create a more interactive experience.

Streamed responses are an option for freeform prompting and chats with Gemini models. The following code examples show
how to request a streamed response for a prompt for each supported language:

```
curl https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1/models/gemini-pro:streamGenerateContent?key=${API_KEY} \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--no-buffer \
-d '{ "contents":[
{"role": "user",
"parts":[{"text": "Write a story about a magic backpack."}]
}
]
}' > response.json
```

## Embeddings

The embedding service in the Gemini API generates state-of-the-art embeddings for words, phrases, and sentences. The
resulting embeddings can then be used for NLP tasks, such as semantic search, text classification, and clustering, among
many others. See the embeddings guide to learn what embeddings are and some key use cases for the embedding service to
help you get started.

## Next Steps

- Get started with the Google AI Studio UI using the Google AI Studio quickstart.
- Try out server-side access to the Gemini API with the quickstarts for Python, Go, or Node.js.
- Start building for the web with the Web quickstart.
- Start building for mobile apps with the Swift quickstart or the Android quickstart.
- If you're an existing Google Cloud user (or you would like to use Gemini on Vertex to take advantage of the powerful
  Google Cloud ecosystem), check out Generative AI on Vertex AI to learn more.

```# File API Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## Introduction to File API

**What is the File API and why do I need this?**
The File API is designed for developers to upload files, enabling the Gemini API to leverage them in multimodal
scenarios, such as attaching images to prompts. This method is stable and reliable for enhancing your applications with
multimodal capabilities using the Gemini API.

## How It Works

**How does this work?**
The File API facilitates multimodal support in Gemini 1.5 Pro, allowing the upload of files and their subsequent
reference within your Gemini API prompts. Files can be attached to your prompts for up to 48 hours, providing the
flexibility to reuse the same file multiple times within this period without the need for re-uploading.

## Supported File Types

**Which file types are supported today?**

- **Images:** `image/png`, `image/jpeg`, `image/webp`, `image/heic`, `image/heif`
- **Video (as extracted frames only, no audio support at this time):
  ** `image/png`, `image/jpeg`, `image/webp`, `image/heic`, `image/heif`

## Integration with Gemini API Prompts

**How does this work with my Gemini API prompt?**
Upon uploading a file, you will receive a unique ID (formatted as a URI under `files/file-id`), which can then be passed
as a reference within your Gemini API prompt.

## Before File API

**Couldn’t I upload files before?**
Previously, files could be base64 encoded and embedded within a Gemini API request. However, this method was prone to
errors and limited to 20MB. The File API now allows for more reliable uploads of up to 20GB per project (2GB per file).

## Video Upload Capabilities

**How many minutes of video can I upload via the File API?**
You can upload 3,600 frames (images), equivalent to 1 hour of video, through frame extraction at a rate of 1 frame per
second.

## SDK Integration

**Will this appear in the Gemini SDK?**
Integration of the File API into the Gemini SDK is in progress. For now, the REST API is available, with example Colab
notebooks provided for both images and videos.

## Authentication and Security

**How will calls to the File API be authenticated and secured?**
File API uploads utilize the Gemini API key for authentication. It's essential to keep your API key confidential and
follow Google's best practices for securing API keys.

## Comparison to Drive and GCS for File Storage

**How does this compare to Drive and GCS for file storage?**

## Comparison to Vertex API

**How does this compare to uploading files in the Vertex API?**

| Feature            | Vertex API | Developer API |
|--------------------|------------|---------------|
| File URIs accepted | GCS URIs   | File API URIs |

## Support for GCS URL Paths

**Will it support GCS: URL paths?**
While Vertex AI supports GCS, the Gemini API currently does not support GCS URL paths.

## Availability in the EU

**Is this API supported in the EU?**
The Gemini API, Google AI Studio, and the File API are not available in the EU at present. Vertex AI is available in the
EU.

## Monitoring File API Usage

**How can I see usage of the File API?**
There is no dedicated dashboard for the File API. However, uploaded files can be programmatically listed using the
ListFiles endpoint.

## Usage Limits and Increases

**Can I request usage limit increases beyond 20GB/project and 2GB/file?**
We are developing a process for requesting limit increases, with further updates expected in the coming weeks.

## Fixes for GeminiAIGateway.php

Here's how to fix your `GeminiAIGateway.php` file:

**1. Model Selection:**

Currently, the `inference` method uses `gemini-pro` as the default model. To use the new pro model, you need to explicitly specify it as `gemini-1.5-pro-latest`. Here's the updated code:

```php
public function inference(string|array $prompt, ?string $model = null): array
{
    // ... (existing code)

    if (is_array($prompt) && array_key_exists('contents', $prompt)) {
        // ... (existing code)
    } else {
        // Use specified model or default to gemini-1.5-pro-latest
        $modelPath = $model ?: 'gemini-1.5-pro-latest'; 
    }

    // ... (rest of the code)
}
```

**2. URL for Pro Model:**

You are correct; the URL for the pro model should use `v1beta`. Update the URL construction as follows:

```php
$url = "{$this->baseUrl}/v1beta/models/{$modelPath}:generateContent?key={$this->apiKey}";
```

**3. Chat Model:**

The `chat` method currently allows specifying the new model. However, you want to restrict it to the old model only. Here's the updated code:

```php
public function chat(array $messages): array // Removed the $model parameter
{
    $modelPath = $this->defaultModel; // Always use the default model

    // ... (rest of the code)
}
```

## Additional Notes

- Consider adding comments to your code to explain the logic and reasoning behind choices like default models and URL versions.
- You can further improve the code by extracting the URL construction logic into a separate helper function to avoid duplication.
- Ensure that your `.env` file contains the correct `GEMINI_API_KEY` value.

These changes should fix the issues with your `GeminiAIGateway` class and ensure it uses the correct models and URLs for inference and chat functionalities.
