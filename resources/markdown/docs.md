# Developer documentation

OpenAgents.com is a platform for building and commercializing AI agents using shared databases of skills and knowledge.

## Concepts

* The primary chat interface at OpenAgents.com allows users to interact with our meta-agent called "OpenAgents", which
  is
  composed of multiple
  Agents.

* Agents are built from interchangeable building blocks called Nodes which are organized into sequences called Flows.

* Example Nodes include: API endpoints, conditional logic, data parsing, and third-party integrations.

* Nodes can be created by community developers by uploading WASM plugins.

* Plugins are a special type of Node that allows for bespoke operations and enhanced capabilities.

* Each Node may have an associated fee, payable to its creator upon use.

* Nodes can reference an agent's Files.

* Users converse with Agents in conversations that are Threads of Messages.

* A Run is an instance of executing a Flow.

## API Overview

We will soon release a developer API.
