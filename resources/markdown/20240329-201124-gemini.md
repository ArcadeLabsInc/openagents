Write the GeminiTest method and feature test for the Gemini API method: files.list

## GeminiTest method and feature test for files.list

Here's the `GeminiTest` method and feature test for the `files.list` method in the `GeminiAIGateway` class:

**File: tests/Feature/GeminiTest.php**

```php
use App\AI\GeminiAIGateway;

test('can list uploaded files', function () {
    $gemini = new GeminiAIGateway();

    // Call the files.list method
    $response = $gemini->listFiles();

    // Assert successful response structure
    expect($response)->toBeArray();
    expect($response)->toHaveKeys(['files', 'nextPageToken']); // May not always have 'nextPageToken'

    // Assert that 'files' is an array (may be empty if no files are uploaded)
    expect($response['files'])->toBeArray();

    // If files exist, you can further assert on their metadata
    if (!empty($response['files'])) {
        foreach ($response['files'] as $file) {
            expect($file)->toHaveKeys(['name', 'displayName', 'mimeType', 'sizeBytes', 'createTime', 'updateTime']);
            // ... (add more specific assertions based on your uploaded files)
        }
    }
});
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Import:** Import the `GeminiAIGateway` class.
2. **Test Case:** Define a test case named `can list uploaded files`.
3. **Gateway Instance:** Create an instance of `GeminiAIGateway`.
4. **Call `listFiles`:** Call the `listFiles` method on the gateway instance and store the response.
5. **Assert Response Structure:** Assert that the response is an array and has the expected keys (`files` and optionally `nextPageToken`).
6. **Assert `files` Array:** Assert that the `files` key contains an array (which might be empty if no files are uploaded).
7. **Optional Metadata Assertions:** If files exist, you can add more specific assertions to verify their metadata based on your uploaded files. 

**Note:** This test assumes that you have already uploaded files using the `uploadFile` method. If you haven't uploaded any files, the `files` array in the response will be empty.
