## Suggested Addition to Feature Test and GeminiAIGateway

**Feature Test:** `tests/Feature/GeminiTest.php`

**Addition:** Test the ability of the `inference` method to handle prompts with both text and image data.

**Code:**

```php
test('can generate inference with text and image data', function () {
    $gemini = new GeminiAIGateway();
    
    // Prepare text and image data
    $text = "Describe what's happening in this image.";
    $imagePath = 'path/to/your/image.jpg'; // Replace with actual image path
    $imageData = base64_encode(file_get_contents($imagePath));
    
    // Create the prompt with text and image parts
    $prompt = [
        'contents' => [
            [
                'parts' => [
                    ['text' => $text],
                    [
                        'inlineData' => [
                            'mimeType' => 'image/jpeg', // Adjust based on image type
                            'data' => $imageData,
                        ],
                    ],
                ],
            ],
        ],
    ];
    
    // Send the prompt to the Gemini API
    $response = $gemini->inference($prompt, 'new'); // Use the appropriate model
    
    // Assert the response structure (similar to existing tests)
    expect($response)->toBeArray();
    expect($response)->toHaveKey('candidates');
    // ... (add more specific assertions based on expected response)
});
```

**GeminiAIGateway.php:**

No changes are required to `GeminiAIGateway.php` for this test, as the `inference` method already supports prompts with
both text and image data.

**Explanation:**

This test case simulates sending a prompt to the Gemini API that includes both text and image data. It checks if the API
responds with the expected structure, indicating successful processing of the combined prompt.

**Note:**

- Replace `'path/to/your/image.jpg'` with the actual path to your image file.
- Adjust the `mimeType` in the prompt based on the image type (e.g., `image/png`, `image/webp`).
- Make sure you are using a Gemini model that supports image input (e.g., `gemini-pro-vision`).
- Add more specific assertions to the test case based on the expected response structure and content.
