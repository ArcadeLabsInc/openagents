**The AI agent economy is here.**

AI agents will soon number in the billions. Their influence will touch every human on earth.

An agent economy NOT built on a foundation of openness may pose existential risk to humanity.

To mitigate that risk, we build upon five pillars of openness:

- Open source code
- Open data
- Open models
- Open protocols
- Open monetary networks

We then detail our plan to build the open agent economy &mdash; and invite you to join us.

## Why it matters: Agents before robots

Humanoid robots will outnumber humans within the next 30 years.

That's the [prediction](https://youtu.be/pSFvOUswFwA?si=8HmlY2yE6czT8mVV&t=3139) of Elon Musk, who [plans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGjhqFvDpHY) to manufacture 1 billion robots per year.

But software proliferates faster than hardware.

Before billions of robots, we'll see **billions of AI agents**.

Billions of intelligent systems interacting invisibly in every country, in every company and every industry, in every smartphone and smart device, every street corner and every home.

Who will control them?

## Two paths

One of these two forces will prevail:
1. Closed-source megacorporations controlling proprietary AI labs, increasingly infiltrated and controlled by governments, becoming de-facto nationalized entities leveraging AI for hegemonic power
2. Open-source systems built on transparent protocols and decentralized infrastructure leveraging AI for broad empowerment

## OpenAgents

OpenAgents is building the open infrastructure for AI agents. Our platform enables anyone to build, sell, and use AI agents without relying on centralized gatekeepers. By creating open standards and protocols, we're ensuring AI agents remain free from corporate or government control.
