## The Case for Open AI Agents

Humanoid robots will outnumber humans within the next 30 years.

That's the [prediction](https://youtu.be/pSFvOUswFwA?si=8HmlY2yE6czT8mVV&t=3139) of Elon Musk, who [plans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGjhqFvDpHY) to manufacture 1 billion robots per year.

But software proliferates faster than hardware.

Before billions of robots, we'll see **billions of AI agents**.

Billions of intelligent systems interacting invisibly in every country, in every company and every industry, in every smartphone and smart device, every street corner and every home.

Who will control them?

## Two paths

Two paths lie ahead:
1. Closed-source megacorporations controlling proprietary AI labs, increasingly infiltrated and controlled by governments, becoming de-facto nationalized entities
2. Open-source systems built on transparent protocols and decentralized infrastructure

The choice between these paths will fundamentally shape the future of artificial intelligence and human society.

## OpenAgents

OpenAgents is building the open infrastructure for AI agents. Our platform enables anyone to build, sell, and use AI agents without relying on centralized gatekeepers. By creating open standards and protocols, we're ensuring AI agents remain free from corporate or government control.
