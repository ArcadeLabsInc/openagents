## The Case for Open AI Agents

We expect billions of humanoid robots to emerge this decade. However, before physical robots become widespread, we will see billions of AI software agents deployed across the digital landscape. This rapid proliferation is inevitable because software can be distributed and replicated far more quickly than hardware.

The critical question we face is: Who will control these agents?

Two paths lie ahead:
1. Closed-source megacorporations, increasingly infiltrated and controlled by governments, becoming de-facto nationalized entities
2. Open-source systems built on transparent protocols and decentralized infrastructure

The choice between these paths will fundamentally shape the future of artificial intelligence and human society.
