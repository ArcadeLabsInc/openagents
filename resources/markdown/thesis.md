**The AI agent economy is here.**

AI agents will soon number in the billions. Their influence will touch every human on earth.

An agent economy NOT built on a foundation of openness may pose existential risk to humanity.

To mitigate that risk, we build upon five pillars of openness:

- Open source code
- Open data
- Open models
- Open protocols
- Open monetary networks

We then detail our plan to build the open agent economy &mdash; and invite you to join us.

## Why it matters: Agents before robots

Humanoid robots will outnumber humans within the next 30 years.

That's the [prediction](https://youtu.be/pSFvOUswFwA?si=8HmlY2yE6czT8mVV&t=3139) of Elon Musk, who [plans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGjhqFvDpHY) to manufacture 1 billion robots per year.

But software proliferates faster than hardware.

Before billions of robots, we'll see **billions of AI agents**.

Billions of intelligent systems interacting invisibly in every country, in every company and every industry, in every smartphone and smart device, every street corner and every home.

Who will control them?
