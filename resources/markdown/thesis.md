## The Case for Open AI Agents

Billions of humanoid robots will emerge this decade. Before physical robots become widespread, billions of AI software agents will be deployed across the digital landscape. This rapid proliferation is inevitable because software can be distributed and replicated far more quickly than hardware.

Who will control these agents?

Two paths lie ahead:
1. Closed-source megacorporations, increasingly infiltrated and controlled by governments, becoming de-facto nationalized entities
2. Open-source systems built on transparent protocols and decentralized infrastructure

The choice between these paths will fundamentally shape the future of artificial intelligence and human society.

## OpenAgents

OpenAgents is building the open infrastructure for AI agents. Our platform enables anyone to build, sell, and use AI agents without relying on centralized gatekeepers. By creating open standards and protocols, we're ensuring AI agents remain free from corporate or government control.
