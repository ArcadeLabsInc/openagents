# Open Protocols and Ecosystem Overview

We build upon open standards and emerging protocols to enable a flexible, composable AI marketplace:

- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: Ensures that AI agent interactions with external resources and tools are well-structured, safe, and always guided by user consent.

- **NIP-89 (Discovery)**: Allows decentralized recommendation of specialized AI services. Instead of relying on a single directory or platform, clients can query a global “address book” to find the best tools for their needs.

- **NIP-90 (Data Vending Machines, DVM)**: Turns AI computation into a free-market system. If a user wants a complex task done, multiple service providers can bid. This healthy competition encourages better results, better prices, and constant innovation.

- **NIP-57 (Lightning Zaps)**: Integrates instant, tiny Bitcoin payments. If you like what an agent or tool provides, reward it immediately. This creates a direct feedback loop, incentivizing continuous improvement, innovation, and user satisfaction.

## What It Means for Users

- **Continuous Improvement**: With direct user feedback (via zaps and marketplace bidding), agents and providers get clear signals about what works and what doesn’t.
- **No Monopolies or Walled Gardens**: The system thrives on openness. Anyone can join, anyone can contribute, and no single entity dictates the rules.
- **Real-Time Value Exchange**: You pay only for what you value. If a service is good, zap it some sats. If not, move on. This keeps the ecosystem honest and focused on delivering genuine value.

## Next Steps

- Integrate zaps into everyday interactions with agents in Onyx, making tipping and paying as simple as sending a message.
- Encourage new agents and tools to join the marketplace, expanding capabilities and giving users more options.
- Continue refining discovery mechanisms, ensuring users can easily find the best solutions available.

Together, these open protocols form the backbone of a user-owned AI future—transparent, dynamic, and truly open.
