# Introduction

OpenAgents is a community platform for building, using, and selling AI agents.

## Building Agents

Agents are built from modular components called **Nodes**.

Example nodes include: API endpoints, conditional logic, data parsing, and third-party integrations. 

Nodes can be created by community developers by uploading plugins. _[Learn about Plugins](/docs/plugins)_

Each node may have an associated fee, payable to its creator upon use. _[Learn about Payments](/docs/payments)_

Nodes are assembled in a drag-and-drop editor using AgentGraph, our visual scripting language for AI agent workflows. _[Learn about AgentGraph](/docs/agentgraph)_

## Using Agents

Agents may be used via OpenAgents.com or our developer API. _[Visit API documentation](/docs/api)_

## Selling Agents

Agents will be listed in our **Agent Store**.

Buyers can purchase agents as-is, or fork the agent template to customize their own version. 

Agents may have fees associated with:

* Nodes
* Data
* Model
