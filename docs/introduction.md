# Introduction

OpenAgents is a web platform for building, selling, and using AI agents.

## Definitions

Agents are built from modular components called **Nodes**.

Nodes may come from community developers.

Components include API endpoints, WASM plugins, conditional logic, data parsing, and third-party integrations, allowing users to build AI agents tailored to specific use cases. Each component may have an optional associated fee, payable to its creator upon use. The platform is accessible through both a web interface and API, including community tools for commenting, rating, and sharing components.
