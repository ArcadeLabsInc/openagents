# Rust Application Environment Isolation Specification

## Overview

This document outlines the approach to creating a somewhat isolated environment within a Rust application. The goal is to enable operations like cloning repositories, running tests, and making file edits without directly affecting the main codebase. The solution should work both locally and in production on the DigitalOcean app platform deployment.

## Requirements

1. **Temporary or Cache Folder**: A designated directory for temporary operations.
2. **Rust-Based Sandboxes**: Isolation mechanisms using Rust's standard libraries.
3. **GitHub Integration**: Ability to interact with GitHub repositories.
4. **Testing and Script Execution**: Capability to run tests and scripts within the isolated environment.
5. **Environment Segregation**: Configuration management for diffe# Rust Application Environment Isolation Specification

## Overview

This document outlines the approach to creating a somewhat isolated environment within a Rust application. The goal is to enable operations like cloning repositories, running tests, and making file edits without directly affecting the main codebase. The solution should work both locally and in production on the DigitalOcean app platform deployment.

## Requirements

1. **Temporary or Cache Folder**: A designated directory for temporary operations.
2. **Rust-Based Sandboxes**: Isolation mechanisms using Rust's standard libraries.
3. **GitHub Integration**: Ability to interact with GitHub repositories.
4. **Testing and Script Execution**: Capability to run tests and scripts within the isolated environment.
5. **Environment Segregation**: Configuration management for different environments.
6. **Optional Docker Integration**: Future-proofing with Docker for higher isolation levels.

## Detailed Design

### 1. Temporary or Cache Folder

- **Local Directory**: A temporary directory within the Rust application for cloning repositories and running operations.
- **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables to specify the path to this directory.
- **Cleanup Mechanism**: Implement a cleanup process to remove old or unused files.

### 2. Rust-Based Sandboxes

- **Isolation with `std::process::Command`**: Use Rust's `std::process::Command` to run external commands in a controlled manner.
- **File System Operations**: Utilize Rust's standard library for file system operations within the temporary directory.
- **Permissions Management**: Ensure operations within the temporary directory have minimal necessary permissions.

### 3. GitHub Integration

- **GitHub API**: Use the `octocrab` crate to interact with the GitHub API for fetching issues and pull requests.
- **Cloning Repositories**: Use the `git2` crate to clone repositories into the temporary directory.

### 4. Testing and Script Execution

- **Script Execution**: Use `std::process::Command` to execute scripts within the temporary directory.
- **Testing Framework**: Implement a testing framework to run tests on the cloned repositories.

### 5. Environment Segregation

- **Configuration Files**: Manage different environments using configuration files.
- **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables to switch between different configurations.

### 6. Docker (Optional)

- **Docker Containers**: Create Docker containers for different environments if needed.
- **Docker Compose**: Use Docker Compose to manage multiple containers and their configurations.

## Example Workflow

1. **Clone Repository**: Clone a GitHub repository into the temporary directory.
2. **Fetch Issue**: Fetch a specific GitHub issue using the GitHub API.
3. **Edit Files**: Make necessary file edits within the temporary directory.
4. **Run Tests**: Run tests on the modified code.
5. **Commit Changes**: Commit the changes and push them back to the repository if needed.
6. **Cleanup**: Remove the temporary directory or its contents.

## Example Code Snippet

```rust
use std::fs;
use std::process::Command;
use std::env;

fn main() {
    // Define the temporary directory path
    let temp_dir = env::var("TEMP_DIR").unwrap_or_else(|_| "/tmp/rust_app".to_string());

    // Create the temporary directory if it doesn't exist
    fs::create_dir_all(&temp_dir).expect("Failed to create temporary directory");

    // Clone a repository into the temporary directory
    let repo_url = "https://github.com/example/repo.git";
    let clone_status = Command::new("git")
        .arg("clone")
        .arg(repo_url)
        .arg(&temp_dir)
        .status()
        .expect("Failed to clone repository");

    if clone_status.success() {
        println!("Repository cloned successfully");
    } else {
        eprintln!("Failed to clone repository");
    }

    // Perform other operations like fetching issues, editing files, running tests, etc.

    // Cleanup: Remove the temporary directory
    fs::remove_dir_all(&temp_dir).expect("Failed to remove temporary directory");
}
```

## Conclusion

By leveraging a temporary directory and Rust's standard libraries, we can create a controlled environment for performing various operations. This approach minimizes the need for Docker and keeps the setup simple and efficient. As the application grows, more advanced isolation techniques like Docker containers can be considered.
