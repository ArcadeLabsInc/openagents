# Architecture Overview

OpenAgents is built as a modern monolith using Laravel and React, connected via Inertia.js. This document explains the high-level architecture and key concepts.

## Architecture Overview

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│  React Frontend │ ←── │  Inertia.js  │ ←── │   Laravel   │
└─────────────────┘     └──────────────┘     └─────────────┘
        ▲                                           ▲
        │                                           │
        └───────────────── SSR ──────────────────┘

## Key Components

### 1. User Management
- Authentication via Laravel Breeze
- Team-based organization
- Project-based workspace switching

### 2. Project System
- Projects can belong to users or teams
- Contains threads and files
- Supports collaboration within teams

### 3. Thread System
- Conversation threads within projects
- Supports both user and system messages
- Linked to specific projects

### 4. File Management
- File upload and storage
- PDF text extraction
- Project-specific file organization

### 5. Team Collaboration
- Team membership management
- Shared projects and resources
- Team-specific permissions

## Data Flow

1. **Request Handling**
```
HTTP Request → Laravel Router → Controller → Model → Inertia Response → React Component
```

2. **File Processing**
```
Upload → Validation → Storage → Processing (e.g., PDF extraction) → Database Record
```

3. **Team Collaboration**
```
User Action → Permission Check → Resource Access → Team/Project Update
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**
- Laravel Sanctum for API authentication
- Session-based authentication for web interface
- CSRF protection

2. **Authorization**
- Team-based access control
- Project-level permissions
- Resource ownership validation

3. **File Security**
- Secure file storage
- Type validation
- Size limits
- Virus scanning (TODO)

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Frontend**
- React component code splitting
- Asset bundling via Vite
- TypeScript for code reliability

2. **Backend**
- Query optimization
- Eager loading relationships
- Cache implementation (TODO)

3. **Database**
- Indexed fields for common queries
- Optimized relationships
- Efficient file metadata storage

## Future Considerations

1. **Scalability**
- Queue system for heavy processing
- Horizontal scaling preparation
- Cache implementation

2. **Features**
- Advanced file processing
- Real-time collaboration
- API access for external integrations

3. **Monitoring**
- Error tracking
- Performance monitoring
- Usage analytics
