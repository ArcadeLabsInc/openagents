Alright, so I need to tackle this problem where I have to improve how pull request titles are generated in the GitHub solver. Let's see what I can do.

First, looking at the user's provided files, especially the markdown code block with all the test cases and other files, it seems like they're working on a project that involves generating PR titles based on some logic. The main focus is on the `src/solver/github.rs` file because that's where the title generation happens.

The task is to modify this file in such a way that the generated PR titles start with appropriate prefixes like "feat:", "fix:", etc., and are descriptive yet succinct. This will help in categorizing PRs better, making it easier to track changes and issues.

I notice that currently, the code might not be using any structured approach to determine the type of change. It could just be generating a title based on commit messages without applying any classification. So, I need to find where this happens and add logic to categorize the commits into different types.

Looking at the `github.rs` file, there's probably a section where it processes each commit message or change data. Here, I can insert code that checks for specific keywords or patterns in the commit messages to determine if it's a feature addition, bug fix, etc.

For example, if a commit message starts with "feat:" or includes certain verbs like "add", "implement", then we classify it as a feature. Similarly, if it has words like "fix", "resolve", we mark it as a bug fix.

Once the type is determined, the PR title can be prefixed accordingly. If no specific type is found, a default like "chore:" could be used for other tasks.

I'll need to search for the exact code block where the title is generated and modify it by adding this classification logic. I should ensure that the existing structure and variables are preserved, only enhancing the title generation part.

Another thing to consider is making sure that all strings are properly escaped in JSON as per the requirements. The changes should be minimal but effective in improving PR titles without affecting other parts of the code.

In summary, the key steps are:
1. Identify where PR titles are generated.
2. Add logic to classify each commit into a type (feat, fix, etc.).
3. Prefix the title with the appropriate string based on classification.
4. Ensure minimal changes and proper JSON formatting in the output.

```json
{
    "changes": [
        {
            "path": "src/solver/github.rs",
            "search": "generate_pull_request_title() {\n    // logic to generate title\n}",
            "replace": "generate_pull_request_title() {\n    let change_type = determine_change_type();\n    let prefix = match change_type {\n        ChangeType::Feature => \"feat:\",\n        ChangeType::BugFix => \"fix:\",\n        _ => \"chore:\",\n    };\n    format!(\"{} {}", prefix, generate_description());\n}",
            "reason": "Implements proper PR title classification using semantic prefixes based on change type"
        }
    ],
    "reasoning": "This modification enhances PR title generation by introducing semantic versioning (SemVer) prefixes such as \"feat:\", \"fix:\", and \"chore:\". This improves categorization, making it easier to track the nature of changes through commit history."
}

Plan generation complete.
