# Sidebar Component

## Introduction

The sidebar is a crucial component of our application's user interface, designed to provide easy access to navigation, project management, and user settings. It's built with flexibility and user experience in mind, allowing for both expanded and collapsed states to accommodate different screen sizes and user preferences.

## Structure and Functionality

Our sidebar is structured from top to bottom as follows:

1. **Action Buttons**
   - Open/Close sidebar toggle
   - Create new chat button

2. **Team Selection**
   - Dropdown to select the current team
   - Teams are the highest level of organization in our app

3. **Project Selection**
   - Dropdown to select the current project
   - Each team can have one or more projects

4. **Thread List**
   - Displays the list of threads/conversations for the selected project
   - Fills the remaining container space
   - Scrollable if content exceeds the available space

5. **User Info (Fixed to Bottom)**
   - Displays current user information
   - Clicks to expand into a menu with:
     - User settings
     - Subscription management
     - Logout option

## Key Considerations

1. **Responsive Design**
   - The sidebar should adapt to different screen sizes
   - On smaller screens, it should be collapsible to maximize content area

2. **Smooth Transitions**
   - Animations for expanding/collapsing should be smooth and non-disruptive
   - Content should fade in/out without abrupt layout changes

3. **Performance**
   - Minimize DOM manipulations for smooth operation
   - Use efficient state management to handle sidebar states

4. **Accessibility**
   - Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
   - Provide appropriate ARIA labels for screen readers

5. **Customization**
   - Allow for easy theming and style adjustments
   - Component structure should be flexible for future additions

6. **State Persistence**
   - Remember user's preference for sidebar state (expanded/collapsed) across sessions

7. **Content Overflow**
   - Handle long team/project names gracefully
   - Ensure thread list is scrollable when it exceeds the container height

8. **Integration**
   - Sidebar should integrate seamlessly with the main content area
   - State changes in the sidebar (e.g., selecting a new project) should update the main content accordingly

9. **Error Handling**
   - Gracefully handle cases where data might be unavailable (e.g., failed to load teams/projects)

10. **Loading States**
    - Provide appropriate loading indicators when fetching data for teams, projects, or threads

By addressing these considerations, we aim to create a sidebar that is not only functional but also provides an excellent user experience, seamlessly integrating with the rest of our application.
