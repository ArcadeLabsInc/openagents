# Lifetime Parameter Failures Report

## The Problem

I've been failing to fix a seemingly simple lifetime parameter issue in `src/server/models/user.rs`. The error is:

```
error[E0195]: lifetime parameters or bounds on associated function `from_request_parts` do not match the trait declaration
```

## Why I Fucked Up

1. **Misunderstanding `async_trait`**
   - I thought `async_trait` would handle all lifetime parameters automatically
   - I didn't understand how `async_trait` interacts with trait implementations
   - I failed to check axum's source code properly to see how they handle this

2. **Wrong Assumptions About Trait Requirements**
   - I assumed adding `'static` bound would help
   - I tried adding/removing lifetime parameters blindly
   - I didn't properly understand how trait lifetime parameters should match exactly

3. **Poor Research**
   - I should have checked axum's test cases for examples
   - I should have looked at other implementations of `FromRequestParts`
   - I didn't read the Rust documentation about trait lifetime parameters thoroughly

## What I Need to Learn

1. **Async Trait Internals**
   - How `async_trait` transforms async functions
   - How lifetime parameters work with async traits
   - When to specify lifetimes with async traits

2. **Axum's Type System**
   - How axum handles extractors
   - Proper implementation of `FromRequestParts`
   - Understanding axum's lifetime requirements

3. **Rust Lifetime Best Practices**
   - When to use explicit lifetime parameters
   - How trait implementations should handle lifetimes
   - Understanding lifetime elision rules better

## Action Items

1. Study the following:
   - Axum's source code for `FromRequestParts` implementations
   - Rust documentation on trait lifetime parameters
   - `async_trait` documentation and examples

2. Create test cases:
   - Different implementations of `FromRequestParts`
   - Various lifetime parameter scenarios
   - Edge cases with async traits

3. Document findings:
   - Create examples of correct implementations
   - Note common pitfalls
   - Share learnings with team

## Resources to Study

1. Rust Documentation:
   - [Rust Reference on Lifetimes](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/lifetime-elision.html)
   - [Async Trait Documentation](https://docs.rs/async-trait)

2. Axum Source Code:
   - `FromRequestParts` trait definition
   - Built-in extractor implementations
   - Test cases for extractors

3. Community Resources:
   - Rust Forum discussions on async traits
   - GitHub issues related to lifetime parameters
   - Stack Overflow answers about trait lifetimes

## Conclusion

This failure highlights gaps in my understanding of:
1. Rust's lifetime system
2. Async trait mechanics
3. Axum's extractor pattern

I need to spend more time understanding these fundamentals instead of trying random solutions hoping they'll work.

## Update (After More Research)

Looking at axum's source code more carefully, I found that the trait is defined as:

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait FromRequestParts<S>: Sized {
    type Rejection;
    async fn from_request_parts(
        parts: &mut Parts,
        state: &S,
    ) -> Result<Self, Self::Rejection>;
}
```

The key insight I missed is that the lifetimes in trait methods must match EXACTLY. I was trying to:
1. Add my own lifetime parameters
2. Modify the signature
3. Work around the system

When I should have just implemented it exactly as defined in the trait.

This report will be updated as I learn more about the correct solution.
