# Projects in OpenAgents

OpenAgents implements a project-based organization system that allows users to group related threads and resources together, enabling more effective collaboration and knowledge management. This document outlines how projects are implemented and used throughout the platform.

## Core Concepts

### Project Organization
- Projects can belong to either a user (personal) or a team
- Projects serve as containers for related threads and resources
- Projects can have custom instructions and context
- Projects support a 200K context window for documents and knowledge

### Project Resources
Projects serve as organizational units that contain:
- Chat threads
- Documents and files
- Custom instructions
- Shared context
- Knowledge base

## Implementation Details

### Models and Relationships

#### Project Model
- Can belong to either a user or a team (polymorphic)
- Has many threads
- Has many files/documents
- Has custom instructions
- Has project-specific context settings

#### Thread Model
- Belongs to a project
- Has many messages
- Inherits project context and instructions
- Can be shared within team (if team project)

### Project Features

#### Context Management
- Projects maintain a 200K context window
- Support for document ingestion and reference
- Custom instructions per project
- Persistent context across threads

#### Knowledge Integration
- Document upload and processing
- Code repository integration
- Style guide incorporation
- Interview/meeting transcript storage
- Past work reference

#### Collaboration
- Team members can view shared projects
- Thread sharing within projects
- Knowledge base sharing
- Context inheritance across team

## Frontend Implementation

The project interface provides:
- Project creation and management
- Document upload and organization
- Thread organization and viewing
- Context and instruction management
- Team collaboration tools

## Testing

The project functionality is tested with both unit and feature tests:

### Unit Tests
- Project ownership (user/team)
- Thread associations
- File management
- Context persistence
- Custom instruction handling

### Key Test Cases
- Project creation and ownership
- Thread organization
- Document management
- Context inheritance
- Team access controls

## Security Considerations

- Projects are scoped to users or teams
- Resource access follows project ownership
- Team projects respect team membership
- Personal projects remain private
- Document access is controlled

## Future Enhancements

- Project templates
- Advanced document processing
- Enhanced collaboration features
- Project analytics
- Cross-project knowledge sharing
- Project archival and backup
- Export/import capabilities

## Usage Guidelines

### Creating Projects
1. Choose personal or team context
2. Set project name and description
3. Configure custom instructions
4. Add initial documents/context
5. Create or import threads

### Managing Context
- Upload relevant documents
- Set custom instructions
- Define project-specific parameters
- Maintain knowledge base

### Collaboration
- Share projects within teams
- Organize threads by topic
- Maintain shared context
- Leverage team knowledge
