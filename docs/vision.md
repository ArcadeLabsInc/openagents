# Vision

OpenAgents aims to ensure the future of AI is open and user-driven, not controlled by large corporations. We believe in:

- **Open Models, Open Data, and Open Money (Bitcoin)**: A future where users freely choose from a wide range of AI models and datasets, and reward providers directly via streaming micropayments.
- **User Empowerment**: You stay in control of what AI agents can access and do.
- **Decentralized Discovery**: Find new tools, agents, and services without relying on any single providerâ€™s walled garden.
- **Global Marketplace for AI Services**: Anyone can contribute agents, tools, or capabilities, and earn sats as users discover and use their services.

The ultimate goal: a vibrant, self-improving ecosystem, where feedback loops created by continuous micropayments and open competition ensure that the best solutions rise to the top.
