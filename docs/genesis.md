## Integration Opportunities

### 1. Physics-Based Data Validation Service

Integrate Genesis as a validation service in the Onyx Data Marketplace:

```typescript
// Example DVM service definition
{
  kind: 5000,
  tags: [
    ["t", "physics-validation"],
    ["param", "trajectory"],
    ["param", "physics-constraints"],
    ["param", "confidence-threshold"]
  ],
  content: "Validate physical plausibility of submitted data using Genesis engine"
}
```

Use cases:
- Validate drone flight trajectories
- Verify object interaction physics
- Authenticate motion capture data
- Generate confidence scores for physical phenomena

### 2. MCP Tool Integration

Add Genesis capabilities to Onyx's MCP toolkit:

```typescript
const genesisTools = {
  validatePhysics: {
    name: "validate_physics",
    description: "Validates physical plausibility",
    parameters: {
      data: "JSON trajectory or interaction data",
      constraints: "Physical constraints to check",
      quality: "Validation quality level"
    }
  },
  generateSimulation: {
    name: "generate_simulation",
    description: "Creates physics simulation from description",
    parameters: {
      description: "Natural language description",
      duration: "Simulation duration in seconds",

           self.area = gs.morphs.Bounds(*area_bounds)
           
       async def train_interception(self, threat_patterns):
           # Train fleet responses using Genesis physics
           policies = await self.scene.train_multi_agent(
               agents=self.drones,
               objective="minimize_threat_success",
               constraints=["no_collisions", "stay_in_bounds"]
