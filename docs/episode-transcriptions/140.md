All right, as of 2 seconds ago, Onyx is open source with a whopping 1 star. So Onyx is your personal AI agent that responds to voice commands, grows smarter and more capable over time, and earns you Bitcoin. It's part of the Open Agents network where every agent makes all agents smarter. Launching December 20. You say it, Onyx does it. Simple crowdsourced agent tool and knowledge base, built-in Bitcoin wallet to buy and sell AI services. Level up your agent and earn Bitcoin awards.

It does stuff, pays, earns in Bitcoin. If you're contributing to the agents' plugin repository or knowledge bases, or doing stuff that's relevant and that you're happy for other people to use, earn some Bitcoin. Cool. We're building on a Bitcoin protocol, Bitcoin Lightning Network model context protocol. We'll do different videos on that stuff. You can read about the prior work video series and there's more stuff in the docs folder about kind of different systems that we're building out. And we'll keep that short.

See you Monday night. Enjoy your weekend. See you Monday night. Enjoy your weekend.
