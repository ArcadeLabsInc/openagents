Hard to believe. We're celebrating one year, we're at 130, but we're trying to catch up to Handmade here. We're just getting started. But I wanted to ask about our videos for our document.

Document, okay, not four, but the episodes come. They give chat, argue with me, get up their episode. And again, payment, decent episodes, auto dev, keep up.

Texting it. Okay, so that's all more or less accurate.

But the problem with that is it's kind of split across the database, our agent, actively name and trace, actually get up the code base. I've been showing lessons. So, a lesson of...

Kind of related. Actually, I had a bunch of problems. We have difficulty at times writing it into pretty much the same.

Problem. Our part isn't the right kind of lesson just to get a code.

Or productive. That was okay. We had a few. I have been. But the real success is basically not ours. So we've been using our sort of agents, agent interface,

Auto dev interface and this pro interface slide format. Now that we have that, now that we have an idea of how we can reason out how to act or other types of things.

Absolutely. I found out how to come up with that. One of the other lessons was that I had that JavaScript. It's actually doing things simply, getting away. And you know,

Part of a bunch of different ways out of JavaScript. And I just came to the database that were productive. And that company, spending a lot on AI tools. A cell, for example,

Hours, that and it's hard to beat. I've tried to read that and it's like running back in. So one lesson is just not getting things in a different way. I don't know, other stacks. But it's really

Stop being cute about tech. That kind of gets to your product before protocol. I, my inner, I want to do that. I spiritually want AI integration that comes out in versatile ads. And then I say,

The practicality—that's just a principle. Some takeaways are the core thesis, as I expressed in the opening video, I agree basically with him. All men this was done a day after I dubbed it. Agents. I absolutely agree with that.

These agents are, I believe, every person on the street corner, every agent's AI agents working either half or all.

Agents will be everywhere. Do you want the massive closed-source operations? More incentive for every incentive. Get their tendrils around the government.

They're more concerned about AI safety and the barriers to keep up startups. We cannot let that happen. These tasks are too high. That's with that love. Interference with evolution. So the general idea is that everyone’s going to have, and also that open is better than closed. I feel extremely strengthened and validated.

Which of these is in the question. I think that far less of what you've got, the election fact that OpenAI's regulatory efforts and anthropological regulatory efforts are probably going to have less impact.

Happen with the election here, where the whole big tech regulatory AI apparatus kind of... to some extent. I mean, it's going to keep the core thesis intact. We're doing the right thing.

We are. I mean, I'll believe it and we're coming after that unit.

Other takeaway: incentivize, interrupt matters. What we had. We had a... Having that process very clearly, that of how we build.

Agent substrate is obviously the idea of operating, probably large. But our...

Condition at Open Agents. I'm going to touch more on the next few important points.

But this is actually pretty good. I would ask, this conversation about, I think, hey, should we have this.

Intensive mechanism. Development for just particular value capture as a way to lubricate interactions, project protocols, and.

I'm asking. Is this not better for national issue providers?

Standard. I'm doing, so like, this is stuff that I've been grappling with specifically, as I think that we see.

The broad strokes of how that needs to happen with, obviously, different Haitian. I'm going to be... Some other founder here is saying, hey, how can we do this?

Should we think that revenue sharing is better than equity? I'm saying agents barely in real. As measured by.

And so we did that piece, but as measured by what customers? Mainly businesses with a budget pay for. Have one platform called Open Agents.

To all the distribution of. Buzz have one beautiful, amazing, reputable brand. And agents.com. Some of these are... All right, I'll pay Open Agents. I'll read it and then.

How it gets spent is answered in part by us. A bit of bulk of. I want to know agents as.

This configuration of things that I am. It's of knowledge or inspiration to have that provided by agent developers.

Again. Data or whatever. As it now, a mechanism. And get rewarded. Personal to that. We think that that is yet connected.

Revenue stream. Okay, so. And. There... No, so you'll see more from us in two weeks.

We're going to put more in eyes in drop. Reaction. Again, system. Our business dashboard.

In use. Still a lot, a lot, a lot more to do. A lot of stuff. To like. Models are still kind of heavily off for a bunch of stuff.

As the... Better. A lot of that. And... Maybe just to the extent that that is a thing. For having you.

Kind of like. Happened in. One thing that I want to say also as a book. I'll actually add this to our takeaway. I do strongly.

Agents. Agents are building all of this. And all of. Best.

Forbitter. Gather. Not old. Feel. We're not inventing the... Agent. Like. How do we start seeing how that happens is.

Fully agnostic. And how. Incentives of that. How do you incentivize the participants? You pay people. Pay people.

What? Pay the money. What? You don't pay them a fucking shitcoin. Some shitty cheesy coupon token that someone paid up. You pay them real money. How do you get real money?

Have customers. After everyone needs to pay us in Bitcoin. Pay us in dollars. We'll handle that part out. Um, but we think that the... Sure, Open Agents. That's.

I think that. So much.

Uh.

Ancient. Of the kind of standard product. Why should people have separate apps or chat apps? I do most of my work.

In this interface. And with this, now Teams integration, I have two different people on the same team that can have the same chat window open.

They can see the same chats coming in. That's live right now. So, it's kind of invite-only for people like hangouts and work. If you want to get access to this, just wait until the end of the coming weeks.

But, yeah, we think the future is multiplayer. There's going to be a lot more that can be done with, like, letting people have agents working. Like, the ability to put agents out there working.

Maybe we have a particular search task that I want to, that is important. Like public policy issues.

I hate. So I want to have some agents research. And maybe I formulate the question and set up, and you can. But it costs money. There's about that issue. I need some Bitcoin to have going.

Have all of this kind of happened more in public. As of this point last year, we'll completely miss the actual collaboration. Enter collaboration.

I think. I didn't think happy for any questions.
