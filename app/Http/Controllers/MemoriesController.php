The code above seems to be correct and standard following the conventions for a Laravel PHP Controller. However, sending sensitive data with Request::all() on update/store methods and returning directly HTTP status codes can be a security risk and is not always the most readable approach.

Here's a possible tweak for the code:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use App\Memory;

class MemoriesController extends Controller
{
    public function index()
    {
        return response()->json(Memory::all(), 200);
    }

    public function show($id)
    {
        return response()->json(Memory::findOrFail($id), 200);
    }

    public function store(Request $request)
    {
        // You should validate your request before using them
        $validatedData = $request->validate([
            'field1' => 'required',
            'field2' => 'required',
            // Add all the fields that need to be validated
        ]);

        $memory = Memory::create($validatedData);
        return response()->json($memory, 201);
    }

    public function update(Request $request, $id)
    {
        // Again, validation should be done before using the request data
        $validatedData = $request->validate([
            'field1' => 'required',
            'field2' => 'required',
            // Add all the fields that need to be validated
        ]);
        
        $memory = Memory::findOrFail($id);
        $memory->update($validatedData);
        return response()->json($memory, 200);
    }

    public function destroy($id)
    {
        $memory = Memory::findOrFail($id);
        $memory->delete();
        return response()->json(null, 204);
    }
}
```

In the revised code, the validation is added and the HTTP response is returned explicitly which is easier to read. This way, you are securing the application by only allowing specific, expected data and being clear about the HTTP response that's being sent.
