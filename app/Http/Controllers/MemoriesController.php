Your new content appears to be a mixture of controller methods and test assertions which follow the Laravel feature test style assertions. These cannot replace controller methods as they don't perform the same function. However, it looks like you're trying to implement HTTP tests, in addition to the existing controller actions.

You can keep original controller methods as they already fulfill their responsibilities correctly (fetching the data, updating, deleting, etc, then returning a response). 

To correctly establish HTTP tests, you should create a separate test file using the `php artisan make:test` command on the command line, not directly replacing these methods in the controller.

Your code should look similar to this:

```php
<?php

namespace Tests\Feature;

use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\RefreshDatabase;
use Tests\TestCase;
use App\Models\Memory;

class MemoriesTest extends TestCase
{
    use RefreshDatabase;
    
    public function testStore()
    {
        $memory = Memory::factory()->make();
        $this->postJson('/memories', $memory->toArray())->assertStatus(201);
    }

    public function testShow()
    {
        $memory = Memory::factory()->create();
        $this->getJson("/memories/{$memory->id}")->assertOk();
    }

    public function testUpdate()
    {
        $memory = Memory::factory()->create();
        $this->putJson("/memories/{$memory->id}", $memory->toArray())->assertOk();
    }

    public function testDestroy()
    {
        $memory = Memory::factory()->create();
        $this->deleteJson("/memories/{$memory->id}")->assertStatus(204);
    }

    public function testIndex()
    {
        $this->getJson('/memories')->assertOk();
    }
}
```
In the code above, we're generating fake memory data with the Memory::factory()->make() and Memory::factory()->create() functions to use in the test methods.
