# OpenAgents

OpenAgents is a marketplace for AI agents built on open protocols. The goal is to ensure that the future of AI isn’t controlled by any monolithic mega-corporations, but rather flourishes as a decentralized, user-driven ecosystem. We combine open models, open data, open money (Bitcoin), and open protocols to enable anyone to discover, build, and monetize AI agents and services.

Our flagship product is [Onyx](https://github.com/OpenAgentsInc/onyx), a mobile app that brings these principles to life. Onyx connects users with AI agents, leverages open discovery protocols, and integrates streamlined payments over the Bitcoin Lightning Network.

## Integrated Ecosystem Overview: MCP, NIP-89, NIP-90, and NIP-57

### Core Vision

We aim to build a decentralized AI ecosystem where users can seamlessly discover, interact with, and pay for AI services without relying on closed, monolithic providers. By combining:

- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: A structured framework for orchestrating LLM capabilities, tools, and prompts with user consent.
- **NIP-89**: Decentralized discovery of specialized handlers or apps for different event kinds, allowing clients to find recommended services in an open environment.
- **NIP-90 (Data Vending Machines, DVM)**: A marketplace model for on-demand computation, enabling multiple providers to bid on user requests and return results.
- **NIP-57 (Lightning Zaps)**: A specification to record and verify lightning payments (“zaps”) on Nostr, supporting fast, trust-minimized microtransactions directly tied to events, profiles, or content.

Using these protocols together, applications like Onyx can:

- Use **NIP-89** to find suitable MCP servers or DVM providers for new capabilities.
- Employ **MCP** to negotiate and use capabilities in a structured, user-driven manner.
- Leverage **NIP-90** for open marketplace tasks where providers compete to fulfill requests.
- Integrate **NIP-57** to handle lightning payments as instantaneous, streaming-value transfers, tied directly to usage and quality of the provided services.

### Enhancing the Payment Model with NIP-57

NIP-57 introduces a workflow for sending and confirming lightning payments within the Nostr ecosystem:

- **Zap Request (Kind: 9734)**: Requests an invoice from a recipient’s LNURL endpoint, referencing a particular agent, event, or service.
- **Zap Receipt (Kind: 9735)**: Confirms that payment was made, creating a verifiable record on Nostr relays.

By integrating NIP-57 into Onyx:

- Users can **tip or reward agents and providers** in real-time with zaps for valuable services.
- Developers and contributors earn immediate, **streaming micropayments**, incentivizing continuous improvement.
- Payment data (zap receipts) becomes a public and transparent signal of value, fueling trust and reputation building.

### Streaming Money and Continuous Feedback Loops

Streaming money—micropayments at milliseconds-level intervals—lets market forces operate instantly:

- **Real-Time Earnings**: Developers who create valuable tools get paid continuously as users consume their services.
- **Rapid Market Signaling**: Lack of zaps indicates low user interest; consistent zaps show sustained value.
- **Dynamic Pricing and Incentives**: Coupled with DVM bidding (NIP-90), prices can adjust dynamically based on speed, quality, and uniqueness of services.

### Trust, Validation, and Reputation

Combining NIP-89, NIP-90, MCP, and NIP-57 builds a rich ecosystem of trust:

- **NIP-89**: Ensures discovery of trustworthy handlers based on community recommendations.
- **NIP-90**: Introduces open competition, where performance and reliability matter.
- **NIP-57**: Financial transactions (zaps) provide a visible record of value exchange, reinforcing trust.
- **MCP**: Enforces structured, user-consent-driven sessions, ensuring safe and transparent orchestration of AI tools.

### Integrating NIP-57 into Onyx’s Workflow

A typical Onyx use case:

1. **Discovery (NIP-89)**: Onyx finds a specialized tool recommended by others.
2. **Capability Negotiation (MCP)**: Onyx negotiates capabilities and pricing.
3. **Task Marketplace (NIP-90)**: Onyx posts a DVM request, multiple providers bid, and one is chosen.
4. **Lightning Zaps (NIP-57)**: Once the provider delivers results, Onyx sends a zap to pay. A zap receipt event proves the transaction took place.
5. **Feedback Loop**: Continuous zap streams incentivize providers to keep improving their offerings.

### Extended Areas of Exploration with NIP-57

- **Multi-Party Splits**: Distribute zaps among multiple contributors—agent devs, plugin authors, content creators.
- **Micropayment-Based Onboarding and Promotions**: Gradually introduce zap-based payments as trust builds.
- **Privacy and Encryption**: Future improvements may allow private or encrypted zap requests.

### Concrete Next Steps

1. **Prototype Zap Integration**: Enable simple tipping flows in Onyx.
2. **Connect Zaps to Agent Actions**: Reward providers after successful tool calls or completed DVM jobs.
3. **Measure Market Response**: Track which agents or services get the most zaps to refine discovery (NIP-89) and ranking.
4. **Add Multi-Party Splitting**: Experiment with more complex zap distribution schemes.

By adding NIP-57 (Lightning Zaps) to the MCP, NIP-89, and NIP-90 framework within Onyx, we encourage a richer economic environment. Users directly reward what they find valuable, developers get immediate feedback, and the entire ecosystem becomes more dynamic, responsive, and community-driven.
